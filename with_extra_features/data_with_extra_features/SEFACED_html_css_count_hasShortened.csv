As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.

"Reagan, I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas? I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. I am not discounting those services.

"Cary, Here is the picture of the house I have in mind. I was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley. A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive. I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. Also the front porch would be smaller. I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.

"Reagan, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. Below is a list of questions on the specs: 1. Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine? Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5. Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial one out of iron. Only about 5 feet. 9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 A/C units? I am assuming 2. 12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron railings? 15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except for change orders?

"Greg, Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates: Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable) What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent? Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit. Why is profit only 4%? Why are the architect fees up to $200K. I thought they would be $80K. What is the $617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high? Who receives the 2 points? How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us? Where is your 1%? Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them $1,300,000? I thought it was less. Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants. I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.

"Jacques, I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time. It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal). One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied. I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price. Can you help clear this up. Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released. Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.

"Gentlemen, Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date. I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed. We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugo's number is 512-295-8052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used. Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday. We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project. Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

"Jacques, George finally sent me some information. Please look over his email. He wants us to buy him out. Keith and I think this is a joke. We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward. I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us. I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market. My version of a buyout is attached. I need your expert advise. I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose. Do they have a case that they are due money for their time? Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance.

Phillip Allen Keith Holst ENRON 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX? 77002-7361 Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout Dear Phillip and Keith: We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ? Sincerely, [IMAGE] ? ? ? George W. Richards President P.S.?????

"George, I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. I still have the concerns that I had last week. Specifically that the costs of our project are too high. I have gathered more information that support my concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total $10.4 Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

"John, Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts? I will set up a room with Kim. Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen: 1. Review and document systems and processes - The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements. I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing scheduling in Unify are grey. 2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.

"Jaques, After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" fees of 10%. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for only true costs + 1.4 million. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

"Jacques, Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? The key business points are: 1. Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours. We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted.

"Jeff, I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. There are several reasons that I won't commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. Can you clarify the dates in the contract. Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.

What is going on? #25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

"George, The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.

"Jeff, Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. A 10% note actually attractive. See below. My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. Sales Price 705,000 1st Lien 473,500 2nd Lien 225,000 Transfer fee 7,500 Cash required 14,500 NOI 100,000 1st Lien 47,292 2nd Lien 23,694 Cash flow 29,014 Cash on cash 200% These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%.

"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""I was getting worried,"" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.

Where did you get these amounts? For what periods? What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

"Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. Specific questions should include: 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

"George, The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive. I have one other investor in addition to Keith that has interest. Some additional background information on Larry and yourself would be helpful. Background Questions: Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in Creekside. Please list projects completed during the last 5 years. Include the project description, investors, business entity, Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors. Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects. With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the investors. Preferable Investment Structure: Developers guarantee note, not investors. Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing. Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns. Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now. These questions are not intended to be offensive in any way. It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that leads to future opportunities.

According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal. At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell $172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00. ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower."" Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees, and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend. Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday. ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader. At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased $206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday. PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled to restart this weekend. At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at $325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday. -Robert Scalabrino PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and falling natural gas prices, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $62.00-$76.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday. ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration the market had pretty much dried up."" Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main reason for the decline in spot market prices. Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of $2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts indicated reduced utility load requirements. In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets. Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13 higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the $67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00- $92.00. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19 to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the market opened down to $59.00 after options expired. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17 lower at $65.00-$100.00. Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively. Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired generation to meet increased weather-related demand. Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu. ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much more realistic prices."" Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00 yesterday. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00. ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said. ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices, causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was forecast for the region this week, traders said. Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week. ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the north."" Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour. ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices, declined to $60 and less."" The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95 to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent estimates. Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week caused prices to decline in the region. In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was the main culprit behind lower prices. ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill. Yesterday, it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold."" Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday. -Brian Whary U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to increase household consumption for space heating, traders said. The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01 pounds a megawatt-hour. Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15 pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday. December continued to fall amid a combination of position closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said. December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade. First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue to stifle demand, traders said. January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence. First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close. Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer 2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour. Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a megawatt-hour. Open positions on many short-term structures will likely force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run- up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more easily be assessed. -Nick Livingstone Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said. Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt- hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076 megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446 megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing. Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating. Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders said. ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price."" Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict temperatures to begin falling. Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22 percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell 4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts. Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week. Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter- term contracts. Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour, 1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers to meet the increased demand, other traders said. Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor, will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said. Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said. -Nick Livingstone -0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf",Normal,0,0,0

"Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

"Larry, Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development opportunities. I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were built by Reagan Lehmann. 22 Units were sold for around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex). I spoke to Reagan and he indicated that he had more units under construction that would be available in the 180's. Are the units he is selling significantly different from yours? He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor plan. My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex. As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.

We have to fully understand the charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today.

(Reminder) Update GIS Information This is a reminder !!! If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS information, please do so. It is essential that this function be performed as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to call Ted Bland @ 3-5275. With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees between operating companies and new ventures. To do this it is essential to have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee data. In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the Enron VP/MD PRC requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education need to be completed via the HR Global Information System. HRGIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet. Just go to hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link. Or just type eglobal.enron.com on the command line of your browser. The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July. If you would like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please contact Kathy Schultea at x33841. Your timely response to this request is greatly appreciated. Thanks, Dave",Normal,0,0,0

"Scott, I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company. I think I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from him. Basically, they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider. Then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk. This is my best guess. I will get back to you with more. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management. In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That risk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity. As to the asset management: do you have any preference on structure? Are there elements that you would like to see? Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Laird",Normal,0,0,0

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth. According to my v-a-a-a-ast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths, this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no one's surprise, will feature some of the musings/wisdom/experience of our Master of Lime, 'Arry . Those same spies/sneaks/sleuths tell me that the format of this next issue is a departure from the norm and may be a Beeg Surprise to some. Me ?

"Folks, I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement - that I think will be interesting to the group. I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00 - a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete. I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash - structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks. Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book. <A Concrete Research by David Moore</A> Regards, Harry Francis",Normal,1,1,0

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt- hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range. ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader. According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight. At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank $202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range. Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage that began March 31. At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00. According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling demand 84 percent below normal. ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader. At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at $175.00-$228.00. According the California Independent System Operator today's forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743 megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. -Robert Scalabrino Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in available generation coupled with less weather-related demand, caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said. According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri, temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively. In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from Friday. ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week long."" Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000 megawatts through Friday. Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to hit the grid tomorrow. Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 nuclear power facilities. The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1 at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned and operated by Niagara Mohawk. Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to $58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to $51.25 and $40.00 indices. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast, traders said. ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said. ""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of that."" The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25 when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired. Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00 and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the Southeast was expected to remain high into next week. Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at $28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee, forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday. ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an ECAR trader said. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up, though traders said transmission problems limited volume. Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50, and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with trades from $32.00-$40.00. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs. For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern half of the region at $45.00-$52.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska. ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said. ""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said. Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is expected to begin Wednesday. Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity, temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week, propelling air conditioning demand, traders said. The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20. Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50. On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range. In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000. ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader. ""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree (Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is 85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us."" On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at $35-$36. Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC. Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range. In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders said. On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades were noted. -Brian Whary U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K. fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling interest, traders said. Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than Friday. The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting price levels, traders said. Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said. June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour. On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15 pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since the start of last week. Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements. Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels, they said. -Amal Halawi Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid limited hydro-supply, traders said. Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00 megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50- 214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour. ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo- based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are steadily climbing.'' Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters. Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet outlooks.'' Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour, down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year. Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour with 140 megawatts exchanged. Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours. -Alejandro Barbajosa -0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf",Normal,0,0,0

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.

"Reagan, I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas?

"Cary, Here is the picture of the house I have in mind. I was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley. A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive. I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. Also the front porch would be smaller. I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.

"Reagan, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. Below is a list of questions on the specs: 1. Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine? Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5. Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial one out of iron. Only about 5 feet. 9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 A/C units? I am assuming 2. 12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron railings? 15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except for change orders? I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.

"Greg, Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates: Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable) What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent? Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit. Why is profit only 4%? Why are the architect fees up to $200K. I thought they would be $80K. What is the $617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high? Who receives the 2 points? How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us? Where is your 1%? Are you receiving one of the points on the loan? What is the status on the operating pro forma? My back of the envelope puts NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses.

"Jacques, The agreement looks fine. My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project"". Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them $1,300,000? I thought it was less. Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants. I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above. Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

"Gentlemen, Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date. I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed. We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugo's number is 512-295-8052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used.

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ? Sincerely, [IMAGE] ? ? ? George W. Richards President P.S.?????

I have gathered more information that support my concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total $10.4 Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price.

"Lucy, Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll: #2 Has she actually paid the $150 deposit. Her move in date was 2/6. It is not on any rentroll that I can see. #9 Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she will start paying on #9 #15 Since he has been such a good tenant for so long. Stop trying to collect the $95 in question. #33 Missed rent. Are they still there? #26 I see that she paid a deposit. But the file says she moved in on 1/30. Has she ever paid rent? I can't find any on the last three deposits. #44 Have the paid for February? There is no payment since the beginning of the year. #33 You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit? The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent. I need you to figure these out immediately. I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll in case you need to research these questions. I will not be in the office next week.

"John, Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts? I will set up a room with Kim. Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen: 1. Review and document systems and processes - The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements. I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing scheduling in Unify are grey. 2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts. Are we looking at everything we should? Putting a person with a trading mentality should add some value and direction to the group. In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD to work part time to get it done. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

"Jaques, After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" fees of 10%. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for only true costs + 1.4 million. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

"Jacques, Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? The key business points are: 1. Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours.

"Jeff, I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. There are several reasons that I won't commit to this.

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far.

What is going on? #25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for. I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.

"Jeff, Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. A 10% note actually attractive. See below. My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. Sales Price 705,000 1st Lien 473,500 2nd Lien 225,000 Transfer fee 7,500 Cash required 14,500 NOI 100,000 1st Lien 47,292 2nd Lien 23,694 Cash flow 29,014 Cash on cash 200% These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%.

"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""I was getting worried,"" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.

If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. Is this right? Has the deposit been made yet? A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

"Gentlemen, I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure and a mortgage broker for help with the financing. Regarding the financing, I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston. I have sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information on you. Can you please send it to him. His contact information is: phone (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net. I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information. I hope to pull that together this afternoon. I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document. He was positive about his experience overall. He did not seem pleased with the bookkeeping or information flow to the investor. I think we should discuss these procedures in advance.

"Jim, I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I described to you last week. The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos. There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved. As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee. If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required. I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing. I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks. I am faxing you a project summary. And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you. Let me know what else you need. The land is scheduled to close mid January. Phillip Allen",Normal,0,0,0
"Jeff, Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th. I have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow. When will more money be required? Escrow for roads? Utility connections? Other rezoning costs? What about property taxes? The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I owned it. Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property? Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned? Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights? What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing? I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and American Multifamily walking on this deal. So I just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can.

"Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. Specific questions should include: 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

"George, The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive. I have one other investor in addition to Keith that has interest. Some additional background information on Larry and yourself would be helpful. Background Questions: Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in Creekside. Please list projects completed during the last 5 years. Include the project description, investors, business entity, Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors. Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects. With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the investors. Preferable Investment Structure: Developers guarantee note, not investors. Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing. Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns. Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now. These questions are not intended to be offensive in any way.

"Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment. We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now. If you have questions, please send an Email to Thank you for your support. Enron Global Technology -----Original Message----- From: Enron on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration Sent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON Cc: Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already. Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses. To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com. IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center. We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to Thank you for participation, cooperation and support. Enron Messaging Administration",Normal,0,0,0
"A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us. Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer). Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron. The laundry list of topics discussed is attached. We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO. We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process. However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this. We will try to get others to sign on to the comments. Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included: ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript). Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time). Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining). All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes. Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future. This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us. Ray",Normal,0,0,0

Who would you recommend starting out of Duce = Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? Answe= r - GG As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai= nst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a= nd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously= not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have t= o go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so = going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a= nswer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol= ina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but= Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at= best, so our hands are tied. =09 Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th= is week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink= e. What do you recommend? Answer - GG Miller has been very inconsist= ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be = facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players= like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b= ig game. =09 Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE Who should I start this week: Shan= non Sharpe or Bubba Franks? Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J= ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av= ailable. Answer - GG Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i= n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha= rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi= ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his = current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not = good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers= will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an= other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa= ntasy player. =09 Tip of the Week Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start = giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves?

"Don't know if you saw this already. Interesting. Ken Indigestion Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not. For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. Addressing a Burning Issue If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn. WINNERS Sales* ($bil) Remarks Calpine $4.6 Its gas power plants won't compete with coal for years Chesapeake Energy 0.9 Hedged gas production through December 2003 Dynegy 43.4 Owns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas Peabody Energy 2.7 World's largest coal company LOSERS Sales* ($bil) Remarks Devon Energy 3.3 Gas-heavy; $8 billion in ...debt General Electric 129.5 Sells gas turbines Pioneer Natural Resources 1.0 $1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gas Transocean SedcoForex 1.9 $4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure *Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. ""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas."" Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.",Normal,0,0,0

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p= ercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio= n, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on e= quity was 14.2 percent. Results for the third quarter were negatively aff= ected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge= of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the = September 11th terrorist attacks. The September 11th events resulted in c= ertain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisio= ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i= nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination = of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after= -tax). The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since= September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl= y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost= of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th= e company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery = expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra = operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat= ed. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses= will be covered by insurance. The third quarter restructuring charge inc= ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a= sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor= ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i= n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio= ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr= ocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec= ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por= tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o= f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves= ted back into high-growth areas of the business. In addition to the activ= ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress= on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea= r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. = Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-= time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down = 19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce= nt. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent. ""While we w= ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro= rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and = we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv= estment activity slowed after September 11th,"" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch= airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. ""In light of = the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower= our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in= itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business= es with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be= nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc= hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in= the economy."" Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom= e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a= year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127= million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include= d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim= e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at= tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income = would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y= ear. TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven= ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a = 28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre= ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc= e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte= r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs= et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch= arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie= lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd= uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter= . The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of = higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque= ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa= in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating= expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine= ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer= ing and cost-control efforts. The above discussion presents TRS results ""= on a managed basis"" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh= ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu= lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo= rmats. On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of= $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m= illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The= se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and= therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses. Americ= an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 = million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.= Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $= 62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note= d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim= s directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc= ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year. AEFA re= sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on = the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly = lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man= agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent. Operating expenses, exclud= ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due= primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-= control initiatives. As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the= company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit= ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct= ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo= lio and concentrate on stronger credits. American Express Bank (AEB) repo= rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i= ncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax= ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi= ng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate= ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year. While AEB s= ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks= , the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co= sts did not impact AEB's quarterly results. AEB's business results reflec= t strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Re= sults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses = as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi= gher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan b= alances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues = to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Co= rporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 m= illion a year ago.

"Phillip, Which one should I do, the 8x12 is half the price. Jeff -----Original Message----- From: Mel Nelson Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 7:06 AM To: Richter, Jeff Subject: October 17, 2001 Jeff: I talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in having our class build a shed for you. We pretty much make whatever you would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are durable and solidly constructed. We build them in our shop and the ownner is rersponsible for their delivery. There is no labor cost so you are only charged for the materials. Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening. I would think that would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually varies between $800 and $900. Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive. It has vinyl siding and aluminum soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe Pronschinske. This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize and legally you are to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it. Your dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though. The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door. We are presently building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up door. The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be roughly $1500. We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your needs. With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to finish that one on time. If you have any questions just e-mail me or call: Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364 My Home number 715-985-3063. Have a good one and take with you later. Sincerely, Mel Nelson",Normal,0,0,0

"Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures. No hand-outs were provided. Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity Topock 540 mmcf/d Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d Needles 800 mmcf/d Wheeler 800 mmcf/d New Receipt Points Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d Both will be available around Feb 1 Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system. Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations. New Calculation, Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance. SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points. Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select. Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts. Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections. Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast. They use Weather Bank as one of their tools. OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide 2 hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well. Lots of complaints. People were complaining that it restricted access to the system. Eliminating point specific calculation. Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits. Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures. No changes to Wheeler Ridge. Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle. Replace windows with operational maximum volumes. If CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows. Scheduling Changes-Nov 1 Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 . No direct dial-up. Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party. However, can still make changes. Can still upload new files. 2 Hour Notice Socal will provide 2 hour notice on Gas Select of OFO. Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers. Gas Select is official notification. Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail. Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free. OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific. OFO's can be declared intraday. Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day. Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on. Don't want to go back and forth. This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works. Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned. Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage. Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week. Can revise expected usage. No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO. Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day of the prior week as proxy. Generators need to revise expected usage. Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal. Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4. Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed. If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules. Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised. If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows: Cycle 1 Nom 1000 ; 0 cut Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized. Will allocate prorata. Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point. In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered. For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week. Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume. For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes. For example: Flow Day 10/4 10/3 Scheduled Volumes Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 2 Intraday 1 Cycle 3 evening cyle 2 on 10/4 Cycle 4 Intraday 1 on 10/4 In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th; look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th; look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th. Winter Balancing Rules Effective Nov 1-March 31 No changes. All customers must comply. Minimum delivery requirements 50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;) 70% of daily usage depending on storage level 70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min 90% of daily usage depending on storage level 90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf plus peak day min.

"Phillip/Tim/Yevgeny Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable. Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase: ? Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role) ? Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report) ? Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before) Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable.

"Greetings Phillip, I received your phone message. Thanks for the update. I have been talking with contractors and Spring Valley. At this point we are trying to determine whether the addition over the garage would be workable. Heather probably told you that I am meeting with a contractor on 11/7 at your home to get a firm bid on the project. I spoke today with the Spring Valley building consultant and faxed him some detail. There are a couple of possible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variance from the decision makers when the time comes. In the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellers disclosure forms from the website you found. We are waiting on the final word from Spring Valley to move ahead. I'll let you know when we have some new information.

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S. The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions. This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization. This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

"Gentlemen Good day. I hope all is going well. If I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. In addition, this includes the condition of what we can change for the two week period following acceptance (see below). This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable. Good news is that this deliverable and the Topic Framework deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project. Thanks Cheers Kirk ---------------------- Forwarded by Kirk McDaniel/HOU/EES on 10/23/2001 03:35 PM --------------------------- Kirk McDaniel 10/19/2001 08:27 AM To: Phillip K Allen/Enron@EnronXGate, Tim O'Rourke/Enron@EnronXGate, Yevgeny Frolov/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Ed McMichael/Enron@EnronXGate, Dutch Quigley/Enron@EnronXGate Subject: Revised High Level Design-Sign-off for Acceptance Phillip/Tim/Yevgeny Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable. Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase: ? Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role) ? Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report) ? Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before) Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

"Philip, What is going on down the street? Curious to hear any perspectives you may wish to offer from the trading floor? Enron stock is now lower than when I joined the company out of business school. I imagine there are quite a few not so happy people these days. We can relate somewhat over here at NPW with a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago). Knowing you, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you down much. I have taken a similar approach to our problems here at NPW. Hope everything else is going well for you and the family. Have you had the knee surgery yet? Give me a call when you have a chance.

Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI I am stuck on my last starter. Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season. Answer - GG Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is looking better each week. Answer - GG Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants' No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with Hilliard because of his experience and continuing improvement. Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson? Answer - GG Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with the hotter player, and that would be Thomas. Tip of the Week Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh. This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

"Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures. NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover. Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk. Turret Users An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"". Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors. While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels. The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment. Here's how: Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret. The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret. To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below: Channel Avaya Stentophon Weather Channel 12401 801 CNN Headlines News 12402 802 CNN Financial News 12403 803 CNBC 12404 804 MSNBC 12405 805 Bloomberg 12406 806 Financial News Network 12407 807 CNN 12408 808 Fox Sports 12409 809 ESPN1 12410 810 Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all. We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move. Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers. Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing. Updates will be provided as they become available.

"[IMAGE] Fantasy Football Newsletter November 16, 2001 [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports [IMAGE]Fantasy Football [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter! The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru."" [IMAGE] Inside ? Plan for the Playoffs ? Game-by-Game Analysis ? Gridiron Guru ? Tip of the Week [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] Plan for the Playoffs The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.) If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season. If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup. Game-by-Game Analysis Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production. Gridiron Guru Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Question - Mike Blake I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten? Answer - GG Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad. Question - Russell Brown My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie. Answer - GG Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. Question - Chris Gilcrest Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, Curtis Martin? Answer - GG Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit is too good to ignore. Tip of the Week Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

"GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th: The schedule is: Course # 7019-00: Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or Dec 31) This course is identical to the courses that started in October. It is being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school. Course details: - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron employees - Each course is limited to eight students - Meets once a week for eight weeks - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to include initial exam) - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline. - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees. Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees. Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance. HOW TO ENROLL: 1. Print out the attached registration form. 2. Complete the form, but please note the following SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS: A. Fill out the student information completely, including your email address. B. In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"", C. In the Payment section: For the course at Enron, the tuition is discounted by $200, to $899. FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is required on the registration form. Be sure to indicate complete cardholder information. 3. Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746. Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review. The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be honored. Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a waiting list for the course or courses indicated. Enrollments and waitlists will be confirmed by email. Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount. Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules. IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT: The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business school. Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants. While work experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially improve in a short period of time. THE TEXAS MBA TOUR: All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair. The participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M. The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call (800) 2REVIEW to register.",Normal,0,0,0
"Thanks. That is an interesting idea. I'd like to keep the rear stairway but that might still be possible. Anyway, let's see what happens with the variance. I appreciate your efforts. By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors? Bob ----- Original Message ----- From: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com> To: <wise.counsel@lpl.com> Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 8:19 AM Subject: RE: word file as promised Bob, I turned in the application for a variance yesterday. The hearing will be on January 8th. In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, the application had to be in by November 9th. I was under the impression that yesterday was the deadline. Sorry if I dropped the ball. On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful suggestions about the addition. It might be possible to move the addition forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space. You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new space for your game/play/music room. Then you could close off the existing play room to replace the bedroom lost. Part of the play room that is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for a built in desk with a couple of computers. This way you would not have to add a second staircase. The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction. In the back you could slope the roof until you were within the setback. Then you could place a large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up. >From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition. The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would be more shaded. That is the west side of the house so that might not be a bad thing. Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or dining room would still be possible. Personally, I think opening the dining room would be the better idea. I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exploring anything except your original plan. But I wanted to suggest something in case the variance was not granted. Let me know if you want me to try and sketch out these ideas. Phillip -----Original Message----- From: ""Robert W.

"I know that this is a difficult time for all of us. With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year. To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed. Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season. Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances. After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8. Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event. I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more. We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season. Ken Lay",Normal,0,0,0

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru."" [IMAGE] Inside ? Thanksgiving Football ? Sortable Standings ? Gridiron Guru ? Tip of the Week [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] Thanksgiving Football Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week. Sortable Standings Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them. Gridiron Guru Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Question - Marcus Howell Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego? Answer - GG Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has never been able to string many good performances together in the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post respectable numbers at Dallas. Question - Eric Fernau Which three running backs should I start? I have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest Holmes and Garrison Hearst. Answer - GG Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. Staley should have little trouble ripping through the Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game. Question - Jay Rassat Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle). Answer - GG Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New England QB. Tip of the Week Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a back like Alexander.

"As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history. We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition. It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs. ? ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program. The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders. Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored. Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service. Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ? Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely. As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations. Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored. We regret that we have had to make these changes. We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.",Normal,0,0,0

"Good morning, In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings. I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them. This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. Thanks, Kam x3-5781",Normal,0,0,0

"Pam, Can you help with below? David -----Original Message----- From: Allen, Phillip K. Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 11:18 AM To: Oxley, David Subject: RE: Answer David, For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3. Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan. The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"". This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution. I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount. I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L. In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1. This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares. Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value. This is the methodology described in Section 7.1. Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns. Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further. Phillip -----Original Message----- From: Oxley, David Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 8:31 AM To: Allen, Phillip K. Cc: Whalley, Greg; Joyce, Mary Subject: Answer For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA, a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",Normal,0,0,0

Also, I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved. If we do not reach the agreement: 1.

"Phillip, Here are the key points that came out of today's meeting: 1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type. 2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next week to gather content and a second meeting for review. 3. We will change ""Gas Daily Risk"" to ""Intra-Month Risk"" throughout the simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk? 4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?

"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking (IBS) Clients: You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line. We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away. To our IBS Billpayer clients: During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support). Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information: 1) You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #. 2) You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as: Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before). Always remember that your password is case sensitive. Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.

"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA, a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",Normal,0,0,0

"Wow! this looks complicated. let me get some help on this and get back to= you -----Original Message----- From: =09Allen, Phillip K. =20 Sent:=09Friday, November 16, 2001 8:38 AM To:=09Whalley, Greg; Lavorato, John Subject:=09FW:=20 Greg, After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de= ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg= arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20 Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis= tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe= nalty. This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision = of the plan. It also states that the account balance shall be determined a= s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re= ceives the written request of the participant. In my case this would be as= of September 30th. I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%= of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001. The plan administ= rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently. Their reading yield= s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St= ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of Enron Corp. sha= res in the account as of September 30, 2001. Their justification is that i= n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th= at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o= f Enron Corp. common stock. There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation. First,= section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.= "" This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se= ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no= t apply. Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib= ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay= ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution. The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3. If that = is the case then section 7.1 should apply. This section does provide for t= he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares. However, it states ""The val= ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin= g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay= ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".= This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every= share in the account on January 1, 2001. Although this would be the most = beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor= p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share, this methodology goes beyond se= ction 6.3. The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of= distribution under each of the three interpretations: Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1 Number of shar= es Relative share Phantom Stock 10% -600=09=09=09=09-54,866 Value to be shares=09=09=09$493,792 Current stock shares=09=09=0949,379 shares I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair. If the = administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7= .1 should apply. The current interpretation of the plan administrators is = a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. = =20 In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the= same issue. I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt= er. Sincerely, Phillip Allen =20",Normal,0,0,0

"Mac, Thanks for the research report on EOG. Here are my observations: Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices: (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. I think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. Current price 37 Nat. Gas 34 Crude 10 Total 81 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?

Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan? Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans?

Internet viewing for investors? Reports to track expenses vs plan? Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project? Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals? Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

"Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time. Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. specialist. Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.

"George, The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive. I have one other investor in addition to Keith that has interest. Some additional background information on Larry and yourself would be helpful. Background Questions: Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in Creekside. Please list projects completed during the last 5 years. Include the project description, investors, business entity, Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors. Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects. With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the investors. Preferable Investment Structure: Developers guarantee note, not investors. Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing. Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns. Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now. These questions are not intended to be offensive in any way. It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that leads to future opportunities. I am happy to provide you with any information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner. Sincerely, Phillip Allen",Normal,0,0,0

We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 to a 41.67 heat rate. We applied forward gas prices to historical loads. I guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year. Prices seem low. Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on Nov 99 loads and current gas prices. What about a forecast for this November loads. Let me know what you think. Phillip,Normal,0,0,0

"Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the ""socalprices"" spread sheet supposed to be in $? If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where did they come from? I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet. As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our comments today along with a cover letter. We have to fully understand the charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today. It's much better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track. Thanks.

"Folks, I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement - that I think will be interesting to the group. I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00 - a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete. I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash - structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks. Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book. <A Concrete Research by David Moore</A> Regards, Harry Francis",Normal,1,1,0

According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal. At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell $172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00. ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower."" Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees, and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend. Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday. ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader. At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased $206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday. PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled to restart this weekend. At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at $325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday. -Robert Scalabrino PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and falling natural gas prices, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $62.00-$76.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday. ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration the market had pretty much dried up."" Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main reason for the decline in spot market prices. Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of $2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts indicated reduced utility load requirements. In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets. Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13 higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the $67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00- $92.00. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19 to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the market opened down to $59.00 after options expired. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17 lower at $65.00-$100.00. Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively. Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired generation to meet increased weather-related demand. Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu. ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much more realistic prices."" Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00 yesterday. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00. ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said. ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices, causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was forecast for the region this week, traders said. Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week. ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the north."" Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour. ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices, declined to $60 and less."" The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95 to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent estimates. Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week caused prices to decline in the region. In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was the main culprit behind lower prices. ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill. Yesterday, it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold."" Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday. -Brian Whary U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to increase household consumption for space heating, traders said. The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01 pounds a megawatt-hour. Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15 pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday. December continued to fall amid a combination of position closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said. December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade. First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue to stifle demand, traders said. January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence. First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close. Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer 2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour. Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a megawatt-hour. Open positions on many short-term structures will likely force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run- up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more easily be assessed. -Nick Livingstone Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said. Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt- hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076 megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446 megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing. Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating. Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders said. ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price."" Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict temperatures to begin falling. Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22 percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell 4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts. Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week. Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter- term contracts. Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour, 1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers to meet the increased demand, other traders said. Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor, will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said. Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said. -Nick Livingstone -0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf",Normal,0,0,0

"Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. Specific questions should include: 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property? Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned? Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights? What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing?

If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required. I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing. I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks. I am faxing you a project summary. And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you.

"Questions about 12/29 rentroll: There were two deposits that were not labeled. One for $150 and the other for $75. Which apartments? 20a or #13? Utility overages for #26 and #44? Where did you get these amounts? For what periods? What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. Is this right? Has the deposit been made yet?

"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""I was getting worried,"" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

"George, The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.

Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

"Jeff, I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. There are several reasons that I won't commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. Can you clarify the dates in the contract. Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer. If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list. Email or call me later today. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0
"Jeff, My target is to get $225 back out of the stage. Therefore, I could take a sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K. This would still only require $75K cash from the buyer. After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around $20K cash. You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email. Do you want to give the New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

"Jacques, Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? The key business points are: 1. Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours. We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted.

"Lucy, Here is the rentroll for this Friday. Sorry it is so late. There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 1. I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. The missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 2. #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 3. #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 4. #11 Missed on 2/2? 5. #13 Missed on 1/26? 6. #14 missed on 2/2? 7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19? 8. #20a missed on 2/2? 9. #35 missed on 2/2? My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on some of these. I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit. Will have some time today to work on a utility letter. Tried to call Wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.

"John, Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts? I will set up a room with Kim. Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen: 1.

I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing scheduling in Unify are grey. 2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts. Are we looking at everything we should? Putting a person with a trading mentality should add some value and direction to the group.

I have gathered more information that support my concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total $10.4 Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

"Jacques, George finally sent me some information. Please look over his email. He wants us to buy him out. Keith and I think this is a joke. We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward. I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us. I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market. My version of a buyout is attached. I need your expert advise. I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose. Do they have a case that they are due money for their time? Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance. There isn't any time to waste so I want to respond to their offer asap. Call me with your thoughts.

Phillip Allen Keith Holst ENRON 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX? 77002-7361 Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout Dear Phillip and Keith: We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ? Sincerely, [IMAGE] ? ? ? George W. Richards President P.S.?????

"Gentlemen, Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date. I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed. We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugo's number is 512-295-8052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used. Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday. We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal).

I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price. Can you help clear this up. Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit. Why is profit only 4%? Why are the architect fees up to $200K.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management. In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That risk may not be acceptable to the desk.

"Reagan, I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas?

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt- hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range. ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader. According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight. At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank $202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range. Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage that began March 31. At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00. According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling demand 84 percent below normal. ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader. At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at $175.00-$228.00. According the California Independent System Operator today's forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743 megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. -Robert Scalabrino Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in available generation coupled with less weather-related demand, caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said. According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri, temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively. In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from Friday. ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week long."" Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000 megawatts through Friday. Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to hit the grid tomorrow. Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 nuclear power facilities. The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1 at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned and operated by Niagara Mohawk. Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to $58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to $51.25 and $40.00 indices. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast, traders said. ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said. ""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of that."" The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25 when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired. Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00 and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the Southeast was expected to remain high into next week. Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at $28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee, forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday. ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an ECAR trader said. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up, though traders said transmission problems limited volume. Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50, and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with trades from $32.00-$40.00. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs. For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern half of the region at $45.00-$52.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska. ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said. ""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said. Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is expected to begin Wednesday. Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity, temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week, propelling air conditioning demand, traders said. The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20. Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50. On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range. In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000. ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader. ""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree (Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is 85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us."" On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at $35-$36. Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC. Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range. In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders said. On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades were noted. -Brian Whary U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K. fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling interest, traders said. Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than Friday. The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting price levels, traders said. Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said. June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour. On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15 pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since the start of last week. Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements. Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels, they said. -Amal Halawi Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid limited hydro-supply, traders said. Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00 megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50- 214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour. ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo- based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are steadily climbing.'' Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters. Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet outlooks.'' Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour, down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year. Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour with 140 megawatts exchanged. Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours. -Alejandro Barbajosa -0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf",Normal,0,0,0

If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS information, please do so. It is essential that this function be performed as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to call Ted Bland @ 3-5275. With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees between operating companies and new ventures. To do this it is essential to have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee data. In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the Enron VP/MD PRC requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education need to be completed via the HR Global Information System. HRGIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet. Just go to hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link. Or just type eglobal.enron.com on the command line of your browser. The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July. If you would like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please contact Kathy Schultea at x33841. Your timely response to this request is greatly appreciated. Thanks, Dave",Normal,0,0,0

"The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO. Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7) To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii) Budget (due Jan 3, 2002) To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii) Seating Plans Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv) Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis. Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are. I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this. I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

"Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90 per sq. ft. excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the true custom home level but should be achievable with good management. Richard Morgan Manager, Green Building Program Austin Energy 721 Barton Springs Rd. Austin, TX 78704-1194 Ph. 512.505.3709 Fax 512.505.3711 e-mail -----Original Message----- From: Allen, Phillip K. Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:19 AM To: Morgan, Richard Subject: Richard, I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's. I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. I already have my blueprints completed. What I took from our conversation was to use the SIP's with 8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. I was wondering about alternatives. Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. But would the foam insulation be as effective? Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money. I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference. Thank you for your help.

The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent. As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent. We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares). If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares. Please let me know you preference. As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt. As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files. He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself) and the various plan provision amendments. If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology. Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

"To our IBS Customers that are still hanging in there: We understand your continued frustration and express our sincerest apologies for our inability to give complete and accurate answers to your questions. The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3) possibilities: 1) You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message that you have exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message ""You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone).

Just wanted to let you know that I will be taking over the role of producint the expert stories for our simulation. I understand you will be obtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories. Thank you for your help. Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind: Number of SMEs needed: 10 Number of expert stories: 20-25 Characteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a mix of structurers, originators and traders I've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will follow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories. The main difference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of 11/30. By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with them for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at least 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday. (11/26-11/28) --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs (11/28-11/30) --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding the simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to discuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot. (12/3-12/6) --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we need and where they can provide stories. --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the stories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video shoot. --Make changes to stories, if necessary. --Send final stories and video shoot logistics to SMEs (12/10-12/12) --Video shoot Please let me know if you have any questions.

"Michelle Here are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature). Sheri When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?

"Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out. I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached. In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here.

"Wow! this looks complicated. let me get some help on this and get back to= you -----Original Message----- From: =09Allen, Phillip K. =20 Sent:=09Friday, November 16, 2001 8:38 AM To:=09Whalley, Greg; Lavorato, John Subject:=09FW:=20 Greg, After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de= ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg= arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20 Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis= tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe= nalty. This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision = of the plan. It also states that the account balance shall be determined a= s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re= ceives the written request of the participant. In my case this would be as= of September 30th. I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%= of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001. The plan administ= rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently. Their reading yield= s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St= ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of Enron Corp. sha= res in the account as of September 30, 2001. Their justification is that i= n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th= at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o= f Enron Corp. common stock. There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation. First,= section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.= "" This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se= ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no= t apply. Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib= ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay= ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution. The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3. If that = is the case then section 7.1 should apply. This section does provide for t= he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares. However, it states ""The val= ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin= g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay= ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".= This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every= share in the account on January 1, 2001. Although this would be the most = beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor= p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share, this methodology goes beyond se= ction 6.3. The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of= distribution under each of the three interpretations: Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1 Number of shar= es Relative share Phantom Stock 10% -600=09=09=09=09-54,866 Value to be shares=09=09=09$493,792 Current stock shares=09=09=0949,379 shares I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair. If the = administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7= .1 should apply. The current interpretation of the plan administrators is = a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. = =20 In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the= same issue. I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt= er. Sincerely, Phillip Allen =20",Normal,0,0,0

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",Normal,0,0,0

"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking (IBS) Clients: You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line. We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away. To our IBS Billpayer clients: During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support). Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information: 1) You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #. 2) You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as: Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before).

According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal. At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell $172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00. ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower."" Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees, and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend. Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday. ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader. At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased $206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday. PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled to restart this weekend. At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at $325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday. -Robert Scalabrino PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and falling natural gas prices, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $62.00-$76.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday. ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration the market had pretty much dried up."" Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main reason for the decline in spot market prices. Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of $2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts indicated reduced utility load requirements. In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets. Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13 higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the $67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00- $92.00. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19 to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the market opened down to $59.00 after options expired. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17 lower at $65.00-$100.00. Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively. Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired generation to meet increased weather-related demand. Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu. ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much more realistic prices."" Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00 yesterday. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00. ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said. ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices, causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was forecast for the region this week, traders said. Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week. ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the north."" Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour. ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices, declined to $60 and less."" The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95 to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent estimates. Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week caused prices to decline in the region. In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was the main culprit behind lower prices. ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill. Yesterday, it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold."" Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday. -Brian Whary U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to increase household consumption for space heating, traders said. The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01 pounds a megawatt-hour. Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15 pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday. December continued to fall amid a combination of position closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said. December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade. First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue to stifle demand, traders said. January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence. First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close. Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer 2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour. Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a megawatt-hour. Open positions on many short-term structures will likely force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run- up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more easily be assessed. -Nick Livingstone Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said. Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt- hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076 megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446 megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing. Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating. Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders said. ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price."" Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict temperatures to begin falling. Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22 percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell 4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts. Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week. Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter- term contracts. Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour, 1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers to meet the increased demand, other traders said. Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor, will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said. Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said. -Nick Livingstone -0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf",Normal,0,0,0

"Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the ""socalprices"" spread sheet supposed to be in $? If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where did they come from? I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet. As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our comments today along with a cover letter. We have to fully understand the charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today. It's much better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track. Thanks.

We still haven't decided what we will provide. You definitely will be included in that discussion once we get the numbers from accounting. Thanks.

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt- hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range. ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader. According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight. At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank $202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range. Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage that began March 31. At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00. According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling demand 84 percent below normal. ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader. At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at $175.00-$228.00. According the California Independent System Operator today's forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743 megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. -Robert Scalabrino Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in available generation coupled with less weather-related demand, caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said. According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri, temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively. In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from Friday. ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week long."" Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000 megawatts through Friday. Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to hit the grid tomorrow. Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 nuclear power facilities. The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1 at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned and operated by Niagara Mohawk. Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to $58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to $51.25 and $40.00 indices. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast, traders said. ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said. ""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of that."" The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25 when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired. Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00 and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the Southeast was expected to remain high into next week. Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at $28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee, forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday. ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an ECAR trader said. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up, though traders said transmission problems limited volume. Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50, and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with trades from $32.00-$40.00. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs. For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern half of the region at $45.00-$52.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska. ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said. ""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said. Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is expected to begin Wednesday. Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity, temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week, propelling air conditioning demand, traders said. The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20. Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50. On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range. In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000. ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader. ""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree (Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is 85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us."" On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at $35-$36. Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC. Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range. In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders said. On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades were noted. -Brian Whary U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K. fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling interest, traders said. Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than Friday. The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting price levels, traders said. Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said. June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour. On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15 pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since the start of last week. Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements. Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels, they said. -Amal Halawi Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid limited hydro-supply, traders said. Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00 megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50- 214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour. ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo- based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are steadily climbing.'' Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters. Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet outlooks.'' Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour, down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year. Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour with 140 megawatts exchanged. Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours. -Alejandro Barbajosa -0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf",Normal,0,0,0

Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs. Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected. The utilities are already in her name. In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip. Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release. Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes. I expect to have that done by Friday. I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday. As far as the utilities go, I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand. I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.

"Carlos, Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions? I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly. Here is my situation. I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago. I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th. I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000. See calculations below: Sales price: 2,100,000 Purchase price 1,200,000 Fees&Devel costs 500,000 Profit 400,000 The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan. I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange. I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify. First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago. I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project. We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me. The loan still exist. I am an 80% limited partner. Another investor is the other limited partner. We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner. We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange? Second, I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000. I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing. I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP. If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property. My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name. Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity? Thank you in advance for your help.

"John, Two items: 1. I spoke to John McKay about Sumas. His views seem well thought out. He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st. See attached spreadsheet. In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10. But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85. Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40 His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet. Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't support that premium. In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book. 2. I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues.",Normal,0,0,0

"jeff, Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE or just above market. If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply? If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time. Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

Subject: Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential Sensitivity: Confidential PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL. As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis. In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron. The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg). When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers). In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market. The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03. The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious). Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts. The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts. Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost. Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access. Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions. (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.) In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts. All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights. We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive. We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT. Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Here is the article: Sector 2 plan geets boost from council By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter H= ome and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised futu= re land use plan to consult for development in the area. The San Marcos Ci= ty Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two = Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 squa= re mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable a= nd appropriate for the region. Significant to the revisions are those affe= cting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corne= r of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street). We= atherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of vari= ous city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner say= s were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two = plan. Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no dir= ect effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density resid= ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of= commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven a= dditional acres of low density residential. In addition, the total eight a= cres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is su= ggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing= development in the revised future land use plan. The total 10 acres of co= mmercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to ""community commerci= al"" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ens= ure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete wit= h buffering and landscaping. A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed t= o separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan. = However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew som= e concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may po= se on the busy state highway. Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing th= e proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Ave= nue. While the state highway department and city would have input into the= plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron= Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between= the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford. Council member Jane Hughso= n supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sect= or Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in th= e area as development proceeds. ""I'd rather say ""no' and if someone comes = us with a really good idea, look at it then,"" Hughson said. Councilman Ed = Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of th= e curb cut. ""It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happe= n there,"" Mihalkanin said. A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclud= e curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San = Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting = against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the= meeting. Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from severa= l residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good = compromise. Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active crit= ic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concernin= g the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests = of the city as a whole. ""This is not a victory for one side or the other,""= said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to= Weatherford's initial plans for his property, ""but a victory for the City = of San Marcos.

The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions. The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations. The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists. ``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company. Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687. El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

(""OEI"") management team over the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as well as Enron's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including the operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and Enron systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services. For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy until September 30, 2001. Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration. Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request bids for each of the gas packages. The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784. << File: OEI.xls >>",Normal,1,1,0

"10:30 (Dow Jones) The key to analyzing media stocks is....automobiles? Yes, it's true, suggest SG Cowen media analysts Ed Hatch, Peter Mirsky and Eric Handler, in this week's Media Money Manager. Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies ""to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports."" Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp.

"David, For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3. Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan. The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"". This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution. I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount. I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L. In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1. This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares. Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value. This is the methodology described in Section 7.1. Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns. Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further. Phillip -----Original Message----- From: Oxley, David Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 8:31 AM To: Allen, Phillip K. Cc: Whalley, Greg; Joyce, Mary Subject: Answer For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA, a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",Normal,0,0,0

"Greg, This spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San Marcos by unit. Next, I want to look at the numbers by bedroom. Let's compare numbers. Here is a list of questions: 1. Unit mixes of all proposed projects. 2. Completion date of Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr. (186) 3. Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds? This spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005. San Marcos will have over 6,000 units. If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%. That would not be a disaster. Tomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data. Let me know what you think. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.

"John, The spreadsheet below (""Valuation Summary.."") calculates the value Enron would realize if we turned back the capacity or released it at full tolls. As of 9/17 mids, the 200,000/d leg would generate $16,918,907 if turned back. There is still a substantial amount of value above variable costs on the books. For 03-06, variable costs are around $0.15 but the mid-market spread is $0.45. The PV volume for that term is 22,000 contracts.

I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal an= d gave the information to us over the phone. The appraised value as built = is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695. The problem is the Land Value is $= 1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Ja= nuary.

"Richard, I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's. I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. I already have my blueprints completed. What I took from our conversation was to use the SIP's with 8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. I was wondering about alternatives. Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. But would the foam insulation be as effective? Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.

We pretty much make whatever you would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are durable and solidly constructed. We build them in our shop and the ownner is rersponsible for their delivery. There is no labor cost so you are only charged for the materials. Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening. I would think that would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually varies between $800 and $900. Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive. It has vinyl siding and aluminum soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe Pronschinske. This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize and legally you are to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it. Your dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though. The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door. We are presently building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up door. The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be roughly $1500. We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your needs. With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to finish that one on time.

Hi Kirk, Here are the answers to some of your questions and concerns on the Topic Frameworks. These updates, along with discussions with SMEs, took a total of one hour. Accounting and Reporting - (1) Deal Flow - <<According to Berney Aucoin>> there is no difference between an Orginator/Marketer on the deal flow, they stated that a deal is a deal and it is the same for everyone. (2) Roles associated within the Desk - <<According to Berney Aucoin >> Admin support and Commerical support should not be added. We are concentrating on the major roles within a desk, any more granular could be inaccurate because it is different for every company. Admin support - answers the phones and Commerical support runs the books in the back office. Commodity Fundamentals - (1) Broker fees and Margin calls were added in the overview, <<According to Berney Aucoin>> it was worth mentioning, but wholesale is exempt from fees and taxes. (2) Industrial, Retail and Wholesale was added as an i.e., by consumption by consumer Organizational Structure - (1) Communication - Inter/Intra department communications were added into the Challenges of Managing Trading Function and Trading System. Inter department communication (i.e., between departments within organization) and Intra department communications (i.e., between roles on a desk after a trade/deal) (between desks, internal communication between Marketer, Originator, Structurer and Trader, after a trade and reconciling position reports) Risk Management Inputs - Consequences within VaR guidelines was added to ""Trading outside of prescribed VaR guidelines Swaps - Types of credit classifications was added to Credit Review under Protecting Againist Loss.

"Michelle, Here are my comments: Section 9b- It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002. Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans. I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the ""Utility Lines"". Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C.

"The project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with Accenture in which Enron pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form.

Also, I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved. If we do not reach the agreement: 1.

Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and 2nd cash flow impact. In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost. (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K) The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one. Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting. Also, I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions. I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time. We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses. One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow. Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization? Please consider the costs of finishing this project.

"Greg, I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format. The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000. But there is not a professional management company. Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000. However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit. This would yield an NOI of $240,000. Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside. The asking price is $2,700,000. Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap. Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap. The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project. The cost per square foot is 36.58. The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million. Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go. This property has not been on the market. So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it. If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million. It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants. Plus the location is by far the most convenient. Financing is the other consideration. I am assuming 25 year, 7%, and 25% down. What do you think could actually be achieved? Can you put me in contact with a lender? I will follow up with a phone call. Thanks, Phillip",Normal,0,0,0
"Jeff, I reviewed your revised offer sheet. I am OK with the effective income of $484K. Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number. The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on. $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI. I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon. He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization. See the attached spreadsheets.",Normal,0,0,0

"Richard, I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included. So that reduces some of the savings. Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home. Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate. Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs. I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do. What are some other alternatives that would also be effective? Radiant barrier? More attic ventilation? Thank you for your help.

Subject: RE: Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90 per sq. ft. excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:19 AM To: Morgan, Richard Subject: Richard, I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's. I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. I already have my blueprints completed. What I took from our conversation was to use the SIP's with 8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. I was wondering about alternatives. Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. But would the foam insulation be as effective? Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money. I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference. Thank you for your help.

We need to get your approval of the points listed below so that we can begin building the application. We can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner's decisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward in time with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners ""more rope"" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order to achieve this, we will have the following constraints: The feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday's meeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L and positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous period. We will not, for example, be able to say things like ""In November, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw gas. What you should have done was..."" We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. This means that if the learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to start over at time period one. We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs, transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the right answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the decisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down any path he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, and the right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actually better if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has already calculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and conversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback we would have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well with the high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in this task. We cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq framework does not support the downloading of data into external applications. The technical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our current development budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learner on the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make the mistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices. If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of day Wednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of this simulation. I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please let me know if you would like to set up a meeting. Thank you.

Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting. Also, I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions. I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.

"Mike & Tony, Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs. Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close. I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis. I don't know if this would be agreeable to you. Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think. If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections. I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors. We are torn between two good locations. However, we are leaning towards Kerrville. The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially. We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to our plan to move to San Marcos. I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately. Phillip Allen 713-463-8626 pallen70@hotmail.com",Normal,0,0,0

"Jim, Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating. Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low. Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith. I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at. Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time. Thank you anyway.

We'll be with family in Austin, and kind of on a maiden voyage in our '83 Avion that we're upgrading for camping! Here's a look at three post offices in a slightly different manner. Remember that the Roma one is about 5 years old, was a 15 yr lease originally. The other two are new. The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10 years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonus kicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease income after it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cash on cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma. We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us know if you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they will last long.

Here are the main points from their conversation 1. Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already."" He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it."" He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best. He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court."" 2. Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B. The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle."" The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office. 3. New Generator Construction Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand. Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer.""",Normal,0,0,0

"John, Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this. However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime. I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit. The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send? The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times. Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes. I know these are not your intended messages. I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR. We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing. My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000. The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation. Please consider these suggestions. We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance. Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

We are hoping to supplement EMF's list of economists and economic modelers who are largely academics or with government labs or offices with folks from companies who can help shed some light on how companies anticipate markets will react to climate policies and the possible changes to prices and availability of cleaner fuels such as natural gas. A description of the 2-day program follows, and we can provide more information on the EMF meeting as well if that's helpful. I would be grateful if you can help identify someone at Enron -- or otherwise -- who you feel could both contribute to and benefit from the discussions with top economists and modelers. If you need more information, please feel free to call me or Leianne Clements (our economist) at the Pew Center number listed below. Thanks for considering, Vicki Arroyo Cochran Director of Policy Analysis The Economics of Natural Gas in the Climate Change Debate (August 9-10, 2001) Determining future demands and supply of natural gas (NG) are important in determining climate policies since burning NG is relatively ""cleaner"" than burning coal and oil. A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus accelerating its demand. However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to more ""dirty"" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax). The Pew Center has found that NG information is often extrapolated from that of oil. Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector, policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change problem. The Pew Center will host a conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University, to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining natural gas issues. A report will be published summarizing the topics discussed in the conference.

(Reminder) Update GIS Information This is a reminder !!! If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS information, please do so. It is essential that this function be performed as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to call Ted Bland @ 3-5275. With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees between operating companies and new ventures. To do this it is essential to have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee data. In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the Enron VP/MD PRC requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education need to be completed via the HR Global Information System. HRGIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet. Just go to hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link. Or just type eglobal.enron.com on the command line of your browser. The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July. If you would like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please contact Kathy Schultea at x33841. Your timely response to this request is greatly appreciated. Thanks, Dave",Normal,0,0,0

They could use some of Cole's coordination. My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now. I am just on maintenance. You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical cyclist. We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months. He never misses, rain or shine. Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial Park on Saturdays. Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the road. I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday. I would like to hear more about your new job. Maybe we could grab lunch sometime. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management. In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That risk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity. As to the asset management: do you have any preference on structure? Are there elements that you would like to see? Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Laird",Normal,0,0,0

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.

"Reagan, I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas? I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. I am not discounting those services. I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0
"Cary, Here is the picture of the house I have in mind. I was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive. I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.

"Reagan, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. Below is a list of questions on the specs: 1. Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine? Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5. Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial one out of iron. Only about 5 feet. 9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 A/C units? I am assuming 2. 12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron railings? 15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except for change orders? I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.

"Greg, Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates: Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable) What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent? Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit. Why is profit only 4%? Why are the architect fees up to $200K. I thought they would be $80K. What is the $617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high? Who receives the 2 points? How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us? Where is your 1%? Are you receiving one of the points on the loan? What is the status on the operating pro forma? My back of the envelope puts NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses.

"Jacques, The agreement looks fine. My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project"". Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them $1,300,000? I thought it was less. Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants. I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.

"Gentlemen, Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date. I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed. We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugo's number is 512-295-8052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used.

As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ? Sincerely, [IMAGE] ? ? ? George W. Richards President P.S.????? Copies of contracts will be forwarded upon acceptance of buyout. ? cc:??????? Larry Lewter ???????????

"George, I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. I still have the concerns that I had last week. Specifically that the costs of our project are too high. I have gathered more information that support my concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total $10.4 Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million. We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects.

Preferable Investment Structure: Developers guarantee note, not investors. Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing. Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns. Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now. These questions are not intended to be offensive in any way.

I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing scheduling in Unify are grey. 2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts. Are we looking at everything we should? Putting a person with a trading mentality should add some value and direction to the group.

"Jaques, After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" fees of 10%. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process.

"Lucy, Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps. I wrote it as if it were from you. It should come from the manager. It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there unit is when they move in. This needs to be written in on their lease. When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up. Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out. You guys can make changes if you need to. Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators. We have to get this done next week.

"Lucy, Here is the rentroll for this Friday. Sorry it is so late. There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 1. I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. The missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 2. #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 3. #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 4. #11 Missed on 2/2? 5. #13 Missed on 1/26? 6. #14 missed on 2/2? 7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19? 8. #20a missed on 2/2? 9. #35 missed on 2/2? My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on some of these. I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit. Will have some time today to work on a utility letter. Tried to call Wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.

"Jacques, Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? The key business points are: 1. Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours. We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted.

"Jeff, My target is to get $225 back out of the stage. Therefore, I could take a sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K. This would still only require $75K cash from the buyer. After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around $20K cash. You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email.

"Jeff, I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. There are several reasons that I won't commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. Can you clarify the dates in the contract. Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.

"Lucy, Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column. The other questions I had about last week's rent are: #15 Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26. What is going on? #25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

"George, The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.

"Jeff, Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. A 10% note actually attractive. See below. My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. Sales Price 705,000 1st Lien 473,500 2nd Lien 225,000 Transfer fee 7,500 Cash required 14,500 NOI 100,000 1st Lien 47,292 2nd Lien 23,694 Cash flow 29,014 Cash on cash 200% These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%.

"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""I was getting worried,"" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

Where did you get these amounts? For what periods? What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

"Jim, I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I described to you last week. The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos. There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved. As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee. If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required. I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing. I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks. I am faxing you a project summary. And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you.

"Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. Specific questions should include: 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

"Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

"George, Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate project: Ownership Structure What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner? What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and liabilities)? Who owns the land? improvements? Who holds the various loans? Is the land collateral? Investment What happens to initial investment? Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans? Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule? Investment Return Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment? Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan? Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans? Looks like it from the cash flow statement. Terms of each loan? Uses of Funds How will disbursements be made? By whom? What type of bank account? Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors? Reports to track expenses vs plan? Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project? Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals? Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names? These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me. Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process. Phillip",Normal,0,0,0

"George, Here sales numbers from Reagan: As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot. The 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling. At 2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units under construction. I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way. The price I am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date. Let me know what you think.

"Folks, I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement - that I think will be interesting to the group. I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00 - a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete. I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash - structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks. Thank you, Mr. Moore.

We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR. It looks as if during the month of June, the book administor loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but assigned multiple master deal ID's. (the code is ""NG-OPT-XL-PRC"") For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June: June 1st $797 million dollars loss June 2nd +192 million dollars made June 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..) This problem makes it impossible to backtest.... Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily increasing your limit to $45 million. This limit increase is in effect until July 26th. The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution can be devised..... I hope this helps.

I assume it is the former, not the latter. Is this correct? Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter? Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know. Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.

"I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average of prices, 5 per week. From: Gary Taylor 10/05/2000 07:25 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Griffith/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: SMUD deal Asian options John(s), How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published? or will it triple count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a similar calculation on weekends). I assume it is the former, not the latter. Is this correct? Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter? Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know. Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD. SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to argue for one or the other. Regards, Gary x31511",Normal,0,0,0
"Adam: Good question. The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly identical product. The fight is over which execution model is superior. I would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct. It's happened in Europe already. The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry. Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically. I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct. The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful. It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

You stated that you spent most of your time on the phone with Traders in New York. When you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron Online?

"Russell: I think I should give you a little background on small ventures. Bill Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship. He is an extremely creative individual. Whalley actually commented on him today as someone ""who thinks outside the box"". Bill actually sat in a bar four years and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth. He has been successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas. As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron. He throws out ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one. He pointed out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for Enron. In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within reason. I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be considered a high priority. I am willing to accept some of the credit risk exposure as a cost of doing business. Bill understands his role as an independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for someone with finite capital. I place very high confidence in Bill not conducting high risk trades. Having said that, we certainly need to monitor his credit exposure and continue to require LC's. Just understand that he is at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade counterparty. I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread option he traded. He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the trading desk, knew it as well. There are a couple isolated products that Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations. This was one product. Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing models created by the research group. The problem with these models is that they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental price limitations. For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within variable cost than the models predict. Thus it is necessary to apply a correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used. Obviously, we have this function in our pricing models. I was not aware this methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models. This has since been changed. Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products. Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to Enron. I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting credit. I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade considering the circumstances. If you believe differently, please advise. Thanks, John",Normal,0,0,0

"I'm not sure what is happening on my position. It may have to do with how you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.

Under the $7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price curves proportionally shifted. Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly. Key findings include: $7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79% $9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the financial desk actually decreased. This would seem to imply that up to the seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces risk). But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and increasing VaR by 74%.

"Dave: A couple things about the limit orders: 1: When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open should default to 12 hours. We want the orders open as long as possible. Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour. Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading session unless specified otherwise. 2. Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size. When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...). I could not overwrite the quantity to be 15,000. 3. Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system saying error trade, price not available. 4. Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, without canceling it and resubmitting a new one? If not, this would be a valuable feature. Thx, John",Normal,0,0,0

"Please take me off your email list Jennifer Green <jgreen@aedc.org> on 09/01/2000 02:50:03 PM To: ""AEDC Members"":; cc: Subject: data standards Dear AEDC Member, One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arena is the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard. This standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and examining data. Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more comparable than ever before. A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to see how the data standards can be made to work for you. There are 25 tables in the standard presented in an excel format. The tabs at the bottom of the page will access the additional tables. You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for the standards. ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which approach works best for you. Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic development profession. They should be of particular advantage to the many areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't received the consideration they deserve. The standards are a great way to tell their story. If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the standards and their use.

"Just some feedback on our EOL discussion. Whalley had similar thoughts about how to address the ICE issue. His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we post 1/8 on ICE. If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75. If someone betters that to 2 bid, we immediately go 2.25 bid. So we are always the best market on ICE so long as it is not inside our EOL 2-way. Thus the only way our best market shows on ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market gets shown. If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid. Our proposal was that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25. Think about which system you like better. Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will be implemented shortly. I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing a product this week. The purpose will be to communicate about the importance of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 2-ways and killing the broker markets.",Normal,0,0,0

Thank You, Ina Rangel ---------------------- Forwarded by Ina Rangel/HOU/ECT on 08/22/2000 01:56 PM --------------------------- Sarah Bolken@ENRON 08/22/2000 08:17 AM Sent by: Sara Bolken@ENRON To: Ina Rangel/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: ENA Fileplan Project Ina, here is information concerning the scope and purpose of our project: We are records and information management consultants from Millican & Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we're taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic inventory of each ENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then ask that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff. There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be maintained. Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and then use the ""imaged"" document viewable from your computer as the working copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call. Thank you.

"Z/F !!!! wow. Who would have thunk it. Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as wide as last year. Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip. Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango. if it couldn't do it this year.... A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve told them to do last bid week. Obviously, more gas trying to come out than is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an Enron, to inject. Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling it out in G. When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f. Storage economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of winter. Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways. Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong. storage boys are withdrawing today and buying that. bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it going to zero? slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/22/2000 06:50:46 AM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc: Subject: re:mkts agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up buying em back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time is busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have the time. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways but one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called impact of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate at all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon. also will be curious how these ""loan deals"" by pipes work ouut. man these guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in the back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep that part of the curve very strong agree? be cool my man-talk later",Normal,0,0,0

"Frank: One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter. In such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $200. The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position currently. But in the winter that may change. Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on. Assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side. While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the payout probabilities may look like the following: 20% $ -.05 40% $ -.02 20% $ 0 19% $ .03 1% $ 1 Enron North America Corp.

"Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree. I think consensus opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the winter. A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those projections seem to be closer to 2.7. With supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the equation. The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies will be stored rather than burned. Each AGA number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter. A low AGA number indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up. Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number may be a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand equilibrium. We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out. If we get two low injections, watch out. Enron North America Corp. From: Frank Hayden @ ENRON 07/12/2000 04:39 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Market Opinion about AGA's John, I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears. In the beginning of the season, AGA's were very important in framing the bull case. The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under stored. I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change that expectation. However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news. At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come from the physical market and weather. I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.

""Cooper, Sean"" <CooperS@EPEnergy.com> on 07/11/2000 08:03:41 PM To: cc: Subject: El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG - news </n/e/epg.html>) today announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69, an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million in the year-ago period. EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT. ``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to accelerate in the second quarter.'' For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515 million in the year-ago period. Second Quarter Business Segment Results The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed to the record second-quarter performance. The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and $19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day. The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million, nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March 2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d. Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3 TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement filed in March. The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's investment in the Philippines. Telecom Update ``We have made substantial progress in the development of our telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A. Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses, we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the telecommunications marketplace.'' Quarterly Dividend The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October 2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000. With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units: Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing, and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the completion of regulatory reviews.

The focus is on Jim Schwieger's storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26 where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process. It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative basis, jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position. This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a big jump in VaR. This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look at column D. The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors: a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the code to review it. b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can propose, is to develop for the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator allowing them to review the fwd vol curve before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol, it can be smoothed. Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings? Vince",Normal,0,0,0

"Jeff: Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit confused by the question. In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done. Market conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas. Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very favorable. I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level. John",Normal,0,0,0
"Andy: The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options. Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes. If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade. If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money. Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market. Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the input into the option calculator is 3.75/4.75, 100 up. In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest, we must continue to support it. Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves. In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off. Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense. It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL. Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to call ENE to close the trade. If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times. Secondly, I would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.",Normal,0,0,0

Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning. Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's position and a corresponding decrease occurred today. John",Normal,0,0,0

"I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better replicate seasonal fundamentals. There are convincing arguments as to why the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time. However, in the previous methodology they blew out. For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 while Cal 10 was .256. I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of July and August over time. The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year. These premiums are as follows: Jan -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006 These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959, the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 4/5 spread was marked at .0475. In the old methodology Jan 2003 = 2.959 Jan 2004 = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005 = 2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044 In the new methodology Jan 2003 = 2.959 Jan 2004 = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005 = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028 The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month premium table The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I change them",Normal,0,0,0

Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at the end. You should be ready to defend your answer. Only a number is allowed, not an algebraic equation. Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer), which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer. You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer. The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking. Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome. If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share. But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share. All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely. By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T. If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management. If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share. Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares. This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known. From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price. Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm. You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press. Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer. In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management. Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50. As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share. What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's stock? $______ per/share",Normal,15,15,0

You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer. The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking. Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome. If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share. But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share. All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely. By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T. If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management. If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share. Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares. This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known. From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price. Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm. You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press. Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer. In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management. Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50. As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share.

i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here. still dont think this is equilibrium. need to see aga coming in lower than expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand curve. think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get close to the psychological 400 target. market needs producer selling to get us through there. have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently. still going lower but it will be a tougher move from here.

"1. don't know. some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent. some will not come back at the same prices it went off. residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall. as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people think it is. maybe #6 is the floor. 2. you know my outlook for xh, with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor. next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity. 3. the obvious 4. yes. believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced. my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y. circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall. 5. not necessarily. will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction. probably.

We need to get a more accurate head count if we would like to have a private Enron event at the Frank Gehry Exhibit. Tentatively, we have May 24th on hold and Frank Gehry has agreed to be in attendance, which is an added-value. The event would be a formal dinner with approximately 150-200 people, including Enron executives and their potential/existing customers. Again, the attendance list is created through your requests but Enron Corporate covers the cost of the event (excluding travel arrangements). We need to make a firm commitment to the Guggenheim by Monday. Please let me know approximately how many people you would like to bring by tomorrow. Feel free to call me at 39056 or email me if you have any questions. Thanks, Margaret",Normal,0,0,0

"unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do. the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model. in my mind, there are three big reasons for skew. one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated. commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve. nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment. however, moving to a different pricing regime tends to bring volatility. an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium. supports a vol smile theory. in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level. nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at $4 and more volatile at $4 than $3. thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew. the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market. to test, regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation. second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts. supports vol smile theory. easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution. third, is just supply and demand. in a market where spec players are bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to add incremetal risk to the book. if you have a neutral view towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more expensive insurance. crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer fences. if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade. if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time. hope this helps, john Sharad Agnihotri 04/04/2001 12:44 PM To: Mike Maggi/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Gas Implied Volatility Smile John, Mike I work for the London Research team and am looking at some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk.

"Looks good. certainly an area we need more focus on. Obviously the most important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term. As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year and five year averages. It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis were geared the same way. The fact that lng shipments are x this week is meaningless. the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely useful. if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move discussion that way. what's switching vis a vis last year. whats production relative to last year. it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

"Andy: Good to hear. There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming online in the US; two more start in the next two months. We are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is. In this framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system. However, we would hold the book, getting to see what everyone was doing at all times. The idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors. Still working on technical issues. The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis. Give me a call if you want to discuss. Andrew Fairley 03/13/2001 11:14 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Trip to Houston John Redmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with regard to EOL for UK gas. We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a considerably greater share of the market. (We estimate 50% now). Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do. There are still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing! As far as we are concerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are executing the strategy you mentioned below. Once again, thanks for your help All the best, Andy John Arnold 21/02/2001 04:26 To: Andrew Fairley/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Trip to Houston Andy: Enjoyed meeting with you. One more thing I did not address. My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL. However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems. We make it a point to never support these if possible. We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid. For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9. The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him. People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off. If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die. I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system. I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals. Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders.

"confused... what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction? From: Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/07/2001 08:55 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: rebuttal I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months. Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand destruction. ? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power demand as a result of Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying is that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure in service industries. ? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have imagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly entrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories. Also they will budget for these prices instead of $2.50 ? See NG Week (3/5/01) Nevada power price hikes affecting casinos --- increases of 20%. When asked the implication for missed earnings and their plans for demand conservation, one casino official replied 'We're in the bright lights business' ? I don't believe the economic doom and gloom First of all no one wants a repeat of the 1990 recession ( which was much worse outside of the US) Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates this week. The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar which will blow exports. With all of the monetary slack, consumer credit will not tighten and thus buying will continue ( witness the lack of destruction in big ticket items purchasing). Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this is not everything. Productivity gains are strong. The economy is becoming more service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the whole story. ? Finally, I am London and it is not doom and gloom over here. well there's my 2 cents.

Natural gas demand will also grow at about 2.3 percent this year, the EIA said in its monthly supply and demand report. Natural gas is the third most popular fuel used by U.S. electricity generating plants after nuclear and coal. U.S. electricity demand in the first quarter of 2001 was forecast at about 896 billion kilowatt hours (kwh), the EIA said. That is slightly higher than the 895.8 billion kwh forecast by the agency last month. For the entire winter heating season of October through March, electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4.6 percent from the previous year, the EIA said. The increase was driven by the residential and commercial sectors, which were forecst to be higher by 8 and 4 percent, respectively. More electricity plants were expected to switch from natural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower, the government report said. ""This trend is expected to continue through the first quarter 2001,"" the EIA said. ""Although the favorable price differential for oil relative to gas is expected to continue through the forecast period, by the second half of 2001, expected increases in gas-fired capacity are expected to keep gas demand for power generation growing."" The monthly report also said that mild weather has eased natural gas prices in California, but the state still faces gas supply and deliverability bottlenecks affecting its electricity plants.

"So my point shown a little bit right now.. Weather a little cooler for this week. Overall normal for 6-10. JV up 12 cents. Think just as customers got totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all the way down. Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the length. This year trade not ready to get really short. Not until healthy inj in April anyways. I think money from here will be made being short, just question of what and when. Think there'll be enough hedging demand to keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level. With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going to dictate prices for next couple months. I think it will be spec and hedgers dictating. Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying. Leads to more upside potential in short term. My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell side leading to pressure on those spreads. The california term power sales have totally changed that. Before, the only thing customers were selling was cal 2. Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from california. Now turning neutral v/x and x/z. You have very valid points. i like q/v more though. I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that with little downside. Thoughts?",Normal,0,0,0

"so according to your analysis, had we been at $2.5 gas and we were not bordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of recorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf? seems a little far fetched to me. Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have had 4.5 bcf a day more demand. that includes commercial residential industrial switching processing... as far as 2 bcf/d power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 5% still and hydro way down. every molecule that can will flow west from waha this summer versus little last year. east power prices really havent reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand. some concern of more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify. we're trying to build the stack now to estimate. frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors. will continue coming back. a little concerned about 2 oil prices. bordering right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 100,000 last week as gas got to parity. let me look into inj capability. definitely bigger when field is empty from engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts. bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now. really inactive. to clarify, not raging bull. i like everybody want to see what the inj numbers in april look like. nobody putting a position on until that starts to clarify. just think that hedging demand is making market a little short right now making next move up more likely. would be scale up seller though not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back. doesnt make any sense. however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to great in my opinion to keep spread there. must close one way or the other. notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday? in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here. 50 cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand. market needs to see some big stg numbers first. i think the best play right now is to start buying longer term put spreads. Jan 4/3.5 look great to me. if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last year's early weather, bombs away. slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/03/2001 07:03:14 AM To: jarnold@enron.com cc: Subject: friday this doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requires power px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient, weather of course. but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak in july-shud be marginal in apr-jun if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction is implied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guys like me turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will be less factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&d swing will be closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think we'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner now rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.00 ie february which is approx where we are today all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i consider extraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occured before-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ie liquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel. some ammonia/fert prod has come back as well. but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/d industrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as mucha unction of an economic slowdown. anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your big fund customers(ospraie). we'll see. is collins bullish as well-he seems quieter in the mkt lately. heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is on a weekly basis? we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 then means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and be unable to inject all the gas available? thots also, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ct discount lately daily vs next month futs? why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get it bt wondering if its transportation or storage cost related. have a good weekdn my man ---------------------- Forwarded by Steve LaFontaine/GlobalCo on 03/03/2001 07:38 AM --------------------------- From: Steve LaFontaine on 03/01/2001 05:01 PM To: sulliacd@bc.edu, Terry Sullivan/GlobalCo@GlobalCo cc: Fax to: Subject: friday i think you are done with hhd/cdd stuff -ie did you complete the cdds vs utilites demand? also monthly hdds vs residential and commercial demand?(combined)?, cdds vs total stock change?? if all these are done add them to the summary sheet in usable formula form-ill show you what i mean then we start our price data base from bloom berg check this out-using the regression you did for nov-march 99/00 came to a draw of 155 with 195 gw hdds, i decreased the draw by the amount i beleive is the y on y supply demand swing. ie 1.5 bcf prod 1.1 bcf./d import 3 bcf/d industrial 1.16 fuel switching .5 ngl neg processing 1.3 r/c conservation =7.4* 7=103 aga came in at 101, so excellant, back testing vs the week prior cam to 81, vs aga 81!!! nt bad-is a very bearish s&d is this continues cuz says injections will be enoromous in the spring",Normal,0,0,0

"I think you need to check your AGA model. 7.2 bcf/d seems awfully high. That's saying that had gas been at $2.5, the AGA for the week would have been 151. Look at the AGA history for last week, this week and next week. 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 3rd week of Feb -64 -46 -64 -63 -77 -97 -136 -81 4th week of Feb -132 -118 -62 -76 -47 -128 -74 -101 1st week of Mar -27 -132 -118 -57 -54 -69 -37 ?? Do you really think the # would have been 151 with no demand destruction? It wasn't even really cold. That would have been the highest AGA # of the three weeks by 15 bcf. Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d. Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages 3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, if any. Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of Feb. Assuming that gets to equilibrium: 2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand. Start with a 400 b deficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in current price environment. I think we are fairly priced fundamentally, but with huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side, surprises in the market right now are to the upside in my view.

Amazing that for the drop in price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere. just a big chop fest. i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated. Agree with 1.5-2 bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG. Imports from Canada should be negligible. Now let's assume price for the summer is $4. No switching, full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running. Electric generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around 1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather. Means you have to price 2 bcf/d out of market. Don't think $4 does that. What level did we start really losing demand last year? It was higher than 4. concerned about recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now. Think gas is fairly valued here. Dont think we're going to 7.

How much lost demand will there be in a month if we're still $5.2? million dollar question if you can answer that. slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/27/2001 08:12:32 PM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc: Subject: Re: mkts off the cuff i wud say tho same goes for 5.00 gas-currently 6-7 bcf/day swing y on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their feet and recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes as current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is no-not unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q. remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started only 6 weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full swing. we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal(ie term px for the summer), starting april we'll have a surplus the other way by july barring a greenhouse in the ohio valley good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong!!! ha John.Arnold@enron.com on 02/27/2001 08:23:22 PM To: Steve LaFontaine/GlobalCo@GlobalCo cc: Fax to: Subject: Re: mkts Good to hear from you.

PaineWebber knows affluent investors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such as private equity and hedge funds. Our group has also found that high net worth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help you structure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives. We then provide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutional money managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions. We also provide the ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlations to the appropriate indices. I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from your previous contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisor was 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour.

"Andy: Enjoyed meeting with you. One more thing I did not address. My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL. However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems. We make it a point to never support these if possible. We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid. For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9. The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him. People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off. If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die. I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system. I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals. Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders.

I believe ENE will continue to be range bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option premium. I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy. To that regards, I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls. I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options. Please look into that for me. John.

All three models move the main cold trough axis to the Great Lakes area by the last half of the period. This shift allows for cold Polar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by days 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American). The Canadian and European continue more troughing in the southern branch in the Southwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued ridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping them warmer and away from the cold. The American eliminates this southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period. The European appears to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases, the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period. All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air. More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be available with the 6:30am ET release. -Matt Rogers",Normal,1,1,1

"Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us. If they shop the deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal. Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published. Physical deals settle much later. My understanding is this is a financial deal. From: Russell Dyk @ ENRON 10/23/2000 12:43 PM To: Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging Deal The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of. In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details. There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify. First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it, for the December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment would take place on February 15, 2000. Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this transaction. CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end of this week. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Regards, Russ",Normal,0,0,1

"a couple of observations from here: cash/futures getting whacked. whereas last weekend cash traded $1 over G, this weekend will probably trade $.15 over. the lack of weather giving the market time to regroup. good thing because another week of cold and the system was going to break. certainly still has that chance in feb. saw utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting any extra demand through spot market. in effect, they said we're not withdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage. they had to encourage marketers to sell it to them, so cash was extremely strong in periods of even normal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather comes again. this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in mkt. g/h getting whacked in sympathy. probably priced 25 term deals through broker market and own originators in past two days. 24 were from the buy side. it's as if pira came in and told everyone term was cheap. however, they've got the opposite view. customers just seeing gas at $4 anytime as being okay now. don't see any let up in back support for a while. front spreads the hardest call right now. g/h h/j j/k ??? can't decide what to do with them and from the volatility in them, appears neither can anybody else. almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march, hoping for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple $20+ prints in cash. probably as likely to happen in g as h and g/h has much less downside. doing well here. actually having the best month ever 11 days in. played front short against term length. got out of front shorts today. probably early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected. will keep term length meanwhile. i've hated summer backwardation forever. agree about u/h. a little less crazy about the trade now because i think the easy money was made over the past two days. unbelievable spec demand for next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and crushed on move down. jv/xh went from 22 to 3.5 in 5 days while front virtually unchanged. don't know what to think of this summer longer term. certainly not as easy as it was last summer when it was obvious $3 was not equilibrium for gas. now $6 for this summer, i don't know. we're gonna have to inject the hell out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time. but we will feel production increase hit the market. just buy vol. slafontaine@globalp.com on 01/11/2001 04:48:32 PM To: slafontaine@globalp.com cc: jarnold@enron.com Subject: Re: ngas and economy im getting really bullish mar/may-deliverabulty ayt these propective stx gonna be hampered big time-thyre expensive but im not sure the mkt has a feeling for what gas can do yet with normal weather and implications on the economy-as a real estate owner getting a little scared. ngas is going to wreck morot gasoline now-watch it go next then maybe heating oil you doing alrite?",Normal,0,0,0

Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in. Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.

Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view. + Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no industrial (basic industry type) can operate. He tracks all the plant closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic conditions- like recession!!). I will try to find out what his total number for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for the summer. While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally think that 1Q02 sees little. I know that the fundamentals group is tracking these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q. He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, crude/propane.... + Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue. I am torn on this one. + Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long nat gas!! through vol or outright. + Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. + The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance (program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.

I have been in London since 12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your holliday season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron) Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a large role in turning the crude and products group around. Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products (especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods. I think you are wonderful and I'm very happy we had the chance to work together. Happy New Year! Jen PS I am coming back on the 6th.

Then it saw a better deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts. It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts -- will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said. ""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know what they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a typical U.S. household. That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual rate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energy price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic slowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices, which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative officer. ""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said. Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but Rosenbury said it would be ""substantial."" In coming months, Terra's good fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,"" Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem."" He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18 million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating now. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that farmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill., indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify continued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble [in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said Paul M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to plant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock."" According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago -- farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond. Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999, and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get more production cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum supplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then [aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more than the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour, says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville for $550 a megawatt hour for December. But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants, to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Out here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Mosey said. , 2000 The Washington Post Company",Normal,0,0,0

Crude went back to the usual pattern and built 2 .4 mbbls, as opposed to an implied draw (excl SPR) of 2 (although half of this in PADD 5). Perhaps surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well above last year's Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3. Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not the finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd. Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.",Normal,0,0,0

"It's funny the spreads in gas. First, in gas, you can play the seasonality game. Does anybody want to buy M/N at 1 back. No, of course not. But in crude, m/n at .10 back is normal. definitely a game as you try to keep month on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is. that's why cal 2 is as high as it is. when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt month. i can't remember w/o looking at charts. it's always the mentality of: if it's tight now what about July or what about winter. i think that's why the winter spreads are a piece. the z/f/g fly is interesting. i think z/f can and will settle backw. just a high prob it goes cantango first. Still seeing sellside interest in term. definitely a result of pira. will probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them and watches the front of the curve. previous to that conference, the producers just didnt want to sell anything. tired of writing us a big check every month. so not only am i in on weekends, but they just put a computer in my house so i can work at home at night. it's really my only time to sit and think without the phones and eol going crazy. they better pay me for the decline in my lifestyle . slafontaine@globalp.com on 10/15/2000 09:26:31 PM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc: Subject: Re: mkts what is a young pup like you doing working on saturday? yea ill check again the numbers but pretty sure they said +3 bcf by dec. ill let you know/its been along week/weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me. i know this isnt same as crude-less mature but getting there so im always wondering if/when the mentality will start to go more that way-ie inverses shud be for only 1 reason-that supply/demand balance will get less tite than it is today. some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk too they still in-im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growing deliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds-and 30 cts inverses will be hard to maintain unless we have crazy weather. we're only 2 weeks from withdrawel period so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds until all the length bails. your rite on the mkt-the anticipation is in the mkt-you gotta have flat px to make money,my approach in the short term as well. that said everyone at pira including pira all bull bull the winter-will be good i think for a win/sum01/win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap. fyi-pira also bearish crude-not saying they rite but will have impact on natgas producers sentiment short term-esp as mideast starts to fiad. for you be careful of the politics effecting heating oil, natgas watching too. there will be some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futs negatively and therefore may roll to natgas-ie if ho goes a big discount to natgas before any major cold-gas will get hit i think. if i hear anything on oil side ill be happy to pass it on-apprec comment on producers not that im surpirsed, wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparks getting hit lately?? good luck man-talk soon. pira was good. you go next year ill set up you some interesting people,good to network cuz we never know where we'll end up. by the way-you bullish sum 02/win 02 or are you rolling a short? non of my biz but i was on the other side-ill add if it narrows more. inkjections next summer will be huge albeit from low stx-curve will mean revert eventually.",Normal,0,0,0

"Kim, I would like to either meet with you, or trade e-mails on your current and possible future target accounts list where GSS may be able to add value to your efforts. Since we're ending 2000 and going into a new sales year, I want to make sure I'm not holding resource open on any accounts which may not, or should not be on the list of focus accounts which you and your team have requested our involvement with. I also want to make sure I'm bringing resource to bear on the accounts which you DO want to engage. For example, at one point Siemens was one of them, and with recent developments, may now be off your list...the last communication I received from the NYC office re: Siemens was via telephone call on November 3rd, where they informed me that the primary opportunity looked like it would be with one of their medical groups based in Chicago. After several unsuccessful follow-up attempts, I placed the Siemens account in the dormant category. Yesterday, Jennifer forwarded me information requesting engagement with your team on CA (Computer Associates) and U.S. Internetworking, and today American Express has surfaced. Consequently, I think it's probably a good idea for me to make sure I'm focused on the right accounts for you. I realize you may be in PRC today and/or tomorrow, so perhaps Friday would work?

"Jennifer, This is apparently the type of deal flip-flop which BMC has been blessing EBS with. In the note from Doug Cummins which contained his updated spend projections, he had the ""Professional Services"" highlighted with a bunch of question marks. It is at the bottom of his sheet, and lists a qty of 30 @ $2000 per = $60,000 --- I assume that's $2K/hour or per day. Either way, it's not something that appears palatable to them (Net Works). I'll be going over there in a few minutes, and will try to check w/each of the guys. I'll keep you posted.

Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten (PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract. EBS may have some Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed materials (while being paid by Enron). Eric is in the driver's seat with the contract at this point. I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one form or another with BMC product and/or personnel. In it, they have been requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles: Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness of the BMC flexibility w/regard to ""purchase commitment"", etc. In addition, I have re-iterated the time urgency. I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them: Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith. I am meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.

Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in. Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.

Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view. + Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no industrial (basic industry type) can operate. He tracks all the plant closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic conditions- like recession!!). I will try to find out what his total number for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for the summer. While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally think that 1Q02 sees little. I know that the fundamentals group is tracking these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q. He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, crude/propane.... + Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue. I am torn on this one. + Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long nat gas!! through vol or outright. + Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. + The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance (program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.

I have been in London since 12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your holliday season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron) Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a large role in turning the crude and products group around. Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products (especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods.

Then it saw a better deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts. It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts -- will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said. ""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know what they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a typical U.S. household. That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual rate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energy price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic slowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices, which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative officer. ""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said. Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but Rosenbury said it would be ""substantial."" In coming months, Terra's good fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,"" Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem."" He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18 million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating now. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that farmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill., indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify continued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble [in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said Paul M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to plant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock."" According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago -- farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond. Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999, and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get more production cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum supplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then [aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more than the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour, says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville for $550 a megawatt hour for December. But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants, to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Out here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Mosey said. , 2000 The Washington Post Company",Normal,0,0,0

Crude went back to the usual pattern and built 2 .4 mbbls, as opposed to an implied draw (excl SPR) of 2 (although half of this in PADD 5). Perhaps surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well above last year's Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3. Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not the finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd. Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.",Normal,0,0,0

"Jennifer, I spoke w/Jenny Rub about almost every BMC/EBS issue, except for this one. I did not know about the issue which Bruce Smith has sent (blue text, below) to Jenny and Bob McAuliffe. When I spoke w/Jenny, I was unaware of BMC's retraction. It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn't seem very ""customer-focused"" on BMC's part. I certainly agree w/Bruce's statement to the effect that BMC needs to meet w/Philippe about their pricing!

Bruce -----Original Message----- From: Smith, Bruce Sent: Wednesday, December 13, 2000 8:35 PM To: McAuliffe, Bob; Rub, Jenny Cc: Robinson, Larry Subject: BMC DEAL Importance: High Jenny/Bob Per the BMC deal, here is where we are with Batch Processing: TidalSoft, Sysadmiral Approx. 90 k ( current quote covers us and GPG and does not include SAP ) We have added a couple of pieces to this and it could bring the cost to 125 k worst case. This quote covers consulting and maintenance. They are trying very hard to get a deal done this year and we could probably get our additional components at the current quote price if we signed. BMC, Control -M Approx. 325 k This is after we remove the SAP modules and components from the quote. Quote that was sent over from Jeff Youngflesh (Enron GSS) was for a total of 628 k Hardware for either product is approx. 300 k. We have conferred with the SAP team and they are not desperate for us to take over their scheduling but think it is a good idea to include them in our long term strategy. They actually do not recommend either of these product's SAP modules and mentioned a third party product (Autosys) that has connectors into BMC. We are not sure at this point about a connector into TidalSoft (Larry if you have info on this please comment). Larry's and his team have eval'd both products and although they are leaning towards Sysadmiral they are satisfied that both products are acceptable. You guys make the call as to whether the additional 200 k is worth the weight it will lend to the EBS/BMC deal. FYI - BMC rep said that we still get 45% discount if we cut the SAP modules. BMC needs to sit down with PB and learn how over priced their products are ! Let me know what you think. If we go TidalSoft I need to push this through or be advised to let it go till the New Year. Thanks Bruce ***** Also in Quote sent over from Youngflesh : BMC, Control SA 1.3 M NOT EVALUATED AT THIS TIME - Is a candidate for future consideration for the Security Admin space but not enough info to speculate as to whether to try and leverage current deal with EBS. I guess they put this quote together from info they received from Henry Moreno",Normal,0,0,0

"This is an excellent update. Thanks for putting this together. Dale/Patrick - lets regroup on how we want to move this onward. Seems like SJ's suggestion of our spending more time with Bill Dwyer is a good one. Thanks Matt Sarah-Joy Hunter@ENRON 12/12/00 02:42 PM To: Matt Harris/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Patrick Tucker/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Peter Goebel/NA/Enron@Enron, Dale Clark/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jennifer Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: HP -- confidential internal document Matt: As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date. Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager Houston, TX #(713)-439-5587 (Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola, sales representative Houston, TX #(713)-439-5555 (To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager Southeast Region Austin, TX (#(512)-257-5735 (Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances Austin, TX #(512)-257-5736 (Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions Cupertino, CA #(408)-447-5240 (To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt, On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting, amongst several, held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development, Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

"Jennifer, Thanks for hosting the meeting yesterday. Sorry I had to leave but I had to meet with Beth Pearlman. I believe there was a lot of good information exchanged and that is why we ran so late. I certainly came away with a different insight to Enron that I did not have before we met. Regarding the relationship between Compaq and Enron, I need to make some things are very clear in our go forward strategy. At the end of the day, the account team (Dave Spurlin up through Jeff, myself and Jerry) own the responsibility for the Enron relationship. If corporate folks are making deals with Enron, we still have to manage the account. Peter Blackmore is very clear about that. He was always preserved the integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer. That is why we need to keep Dave focused and knowing what transactions are taking place within Enron. He isn't the decision maker on deals like the EBS one, but as you are well aware of, the EBS contract has impaired other business opportunities within Enron. Dave's sole responsibility is Enron and making sure that your needs are being met. He will direct and assist in making sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the relationship with Enron. I need your help with all Enron organizations to make sure that they use Dave as the focal point. If folks continue to go around him, situations like EBS will continue. He has to have the total picture of business transactions happening at Enron. He will understand how those situations can impact the business at and for Enron. Secondly, attached is the information that I received regarding contracts with Enron. Regarding the Power/Gas contact it is a 5-year deal with the sixth year being optional. The annual outlay is estimated to be $16.1M per year. I did make an error in using the $97M divided 5 years versus 6 years. So at 5 years the value is $80.5M. If you have something different, let's make sure that we are on the same page. I have attached the emails that I received this data from. <<RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.>> <<RE: Enron Building Services Novi MI.>> Regarding the EBS deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level set very quickly. Compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive light. Compaq will honor it's commitments but we need to make sure that Enron does the same. The bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of expectations relative to Compaq's revenue from EBS versus what actually got booked. Our expectations were $96M a year based on the forecast provided by EBS, certainly not $14M (based on what we agreed to yesterday). I find it very difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held accountable for our portion of the deal, when we don't have the revenue to off set it. Based on what I have heard, both parties had shortcomings based on expectations that were set. I will speak to Keith and Rob this morning to see how it was left. I also need to get your perspective on the transaction. Jennifer, if there is a business opportunity, Compaq certainly wants to continue in pursuing that with Enron. Provided it's equitable for both sides. I realized that this is a difficult situation, but we will get through it. Jennifer, once again I appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and hosting Compaq. I will contact you later today.

Sensitivity: Confidential Michael, Thanks for the update. I am OK with your decision not to select Enron (and I also reviewed with Jim Milton). Given that Enron chose not to rebid, I certainly think this is a reasonable decision. It is very important that I (and the Enron account team) stay informed on all of these issues, so thanks again for keeping us in the loop. Regards, Jerry -----Original Message----- From: Fiore, Michael Sent: Wednesday, October 04, 2000 10:59 AM To: Earle, Jerry Cc: Leach, Renee Subject: Enron Building Services Novi MI. Importance: High Sensitivity: Confidential Jerry, As part of our continuing communication with the Compaq/Enron account team, below is an overview of a recent bid analysis for services at Compaq's Novi, MI site. Enron Building Services is the current service provider for Office Services related support. The proposed pricing received by Pitney Bowes is 11.1% or $15,147 lower than the price provided by Enron. Enron has been given the opportunity to revise their pricing but has chose not to. The recommendation is to award the business to Pitney Bowes. Please confirm that you concur with our recommendation. Thanks. ------------ Background: Enron Building Services was providing a facility manager, shipper receiver, receptionist and admin/help desk support for Compaq's Novi, MI site. Compaq recently chose to hire the facility manager as a permanent Compaq employee. Enron Building Services provided Compaq with revised pricing to reflect the modified scope of work. The pricing provided by Enron was 11.1% higher than the price received by Pitney Bowes. The Enron account team has been informed that their pricing is not competitive and they been given the opportunity to lower their price. They have opted not to lower the price. The recommendation of both Real Estate and Procurement is to award the business to Pitney Bowes. Enron Building Services Current Cost: Base cost for services was $190,198.00 Admin/Help Desk $44,787.00 Ship/Rec $35,521.00 Receptionist $38,610.00 Facilities Manager $71,280.00 Mail Van/Car (remote site support) $13,030.00 Management Fee $14,210.00 Total Cost $216,438.00 Compaq hired the facility manager as a badged employee. Enron Building Services Proposed Cost: Base cost for remaining services $128,071.00 Admin/Help Desk $53,940.00 Ship/Rec $35,521.00 Receptionist $38,610.00 Mail Van/Car (deleted) Management Fee $8,324.00 Total Cost $136,395.00 Issue: 20% increase in Admin/Help desk cost. Pitney Bowes has submitted a proposal to provide Admin/Help Desk coverage, Shipper/Receiver, Receptionist for a total cost of. $121,248.00 which is 11.1% less than EBS proposal.

"Good plan. I agree re SJ. She is on the ball. mh Patrick Tucker 12/14/00 04:28 PM To: Matt Harris/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Dale Clark/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Subject: Re: HP -- confidential internal document I agree. Sarah-Joy and I had a detailed follow-on conversation today about this topic, and we're in agreement as to how things can move forward. I'd definitely like to have Bill rejoin our conversation with our new overall commercial contact at HP, whose name Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy will supply in the very near future. I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless decision, the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business, and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably linked. Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more recent conversations, which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg understand that his focus was different than ours. Sarah-Joy has brought immense focus and organization to this process. I have certainly found her involvement invaluable.

Thanks for putting this together. Dale/Patrick - lets regroup on how we want to move this onward. Seems like SJ's suggestion of our spending more time with Bill Dwyer is a good one. Thanks Matt Sarah-Joy Hunter@ENRON 12/12/00 02:42 PM To: Matt Harris/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Patrick Tucker/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Peter Goebel/NA/Enron@Enron, Dale Clark/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jennifer Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: HP -- confidential internal document Matt: As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date. Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager Houston, TX #(713)-439-5587 (Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola, sales representative Houston, TX #(713)-439-5555 (To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager Southeast Region Austin, TX (#(512)-257-5735 (Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances Austin, TX #(512)-257-5736 (Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions Cupertino, CA #(408)-447-5240 (To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt, On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting, amongst several, held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development, Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

After some quick analysis it looks like we overestimated the opportunity. The circuits Dietmar is requesting is a european E1 which equates to a US T1. The hub (Wallfdorf) -and-spoke (Hungary, Netherlands, UK) model SAP requires works out to roughly a $2.09M deal. Clearly this is smaller than both parties would prefer.Thus we would like to know if there are growth plans for one or more of these connections so that we can we propose a larger pipe (i.e. European E3/US DS3). For example if just one of the connections can be an E3 for the entire contract (ten years) it would bump the value up to $8.5M. Please review this and let's plan on talking later today. Another model to consider would be to progressively bump up the pipe size across all the connections at set intervals (i.e. years 1-3 = E1, years 4-6 = E2, years 7-10 = E3).

"Chaz and Steve, Here's the latest, in a nutshell. Basically, the testing is not fully completed, even where we might have felt that it was close (because there is also a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the purchase decision). As you know, both Randy Matson and Bob McAuliffe are out on vacation, so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas. However, it looks like there has been enough feedback to/through them to surmise that BMC is not in the driver's seat in either situation. In a meeting today, it became apparent that BMC's revenue opportunity with the Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at EBS. The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema Manager tool, and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim, especially given the time constraints imposed in your situation. Still, the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential vendor; but neither is there a commitment (written OR verbal) to make a BMC purchase at this point. I will be on vacation next week, but will be checking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th. Jennifer or I will keep you posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor. I have sent you a paraphrased version of Doug's most recent communication to me. The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net Works teams in question: more testing, but looks like BMC's total sales opportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your deal done. The issues mentioned in the other summary update note from yesterday still apply.

"Jennifer: If you are referring to the Wireless call, I was on the call and actively participated with Peter G. I had the agenda discussion items and guided the conversation. The call was brief and enabled HP and Peter G. to discuss wireless initiatives briefly. Then Peter G. literally read from my notes the ""message"" you gave him about the need for HP to support the process on both the buy and sell sides. The call went well, message was delivered and Darrin will follow up with HP so they can come in to Enron and present the wireless intiative. Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy (but not Gerry Cashiola) were on the call.

For FEDEX: (cross sell) I will be speaking with Buck McGugan, VP of sales, Carmen Perez's boss's boss this morning at his office in Chicago. 847-215-4241. This is a follow up call to the calls from different Fedex business units which I have received. (buy side--John Will) I forwarded John's latest update earlier this week then his note below. First, he had several conference calls with George Wasaff to John Pattillo. John Pattillo had committed to getting back to John on Friday (he didn't) with the specifics of ABS' counter offer to FEDEX. John's e-mail below notes that on Friday 12/15 by noon he heard nothing back from Pattillo. Second, John is to hear back from Carmen Perez today, Fedex account rep, on any news from Fedex lawyers and team regarding Fedex's response to lawsuit issue update. Third, George Wasaff has made himself available to fly to Memphis with John this week if necessary and if this will help resolve the lawsuit issue in our favor. Fourth, John has been told to begin to pull back business from FEDEX in terms of the GSS contractual relationship. I've asked John to keep us in the loop on the developments with these four items and what he finally decides to do 12/22 on the Fedex account. HP: Wireless conference call with Peter G. went fine. Peter G. has asked Darrin to set up a follow up meeting with HP after 1/8/01 when the Enron wireless team returns from London. This is in progress. EFS/Datawarehouse equipment meeting set for early Jan. Spoke with Peter G. I spoke with Bill Dwyer directly last week and he would welcome the opportunity to work more closely with Enron but would want to work in concert with the sales force. My e-mailed question to you was as follows: Do we just wait to hear back from Greg Pyle given your phone call to him and Peter G. message delivered to him on 12/14? Kinko's: Connected Mike Rabon to Kinko's CIO via conference call. That enables the EBS proposition to move forward with Kinko's. Also, connected Ed Quinn and Chris Charbonneau to VP of purchasing. He is the initial decision maker. Chris Charbonneau and I got on a follow up conference call with VP of Purchasing and found that he had already received a business proposition from EIM Pulp & Paper team 9 months ago. But, the offer was not as competitive as the options offered by the Kinko's paper mills. Ed and Chris have some homework to do to improve the offer and get back to the VP of Purchasing. Once we get past this initial hurdle, I will work with Quinn and Charbonneau on getting to the CFO's office as necessary. So, both sides are moving foward here. Also, had Ed Quinn meet with Craig Brown and Tracy F. on office automation (pulled Jeff Youngflesh up to speed as well) since he couldn't attend the meeting. Ed had some great ideas for the process. Continental: Wasaff will speak briefly with Ron Howard on Wednesday at 1:30 PM as a follow up thank-you. Meeting minutes sent out. Will be working with Craig Breslau and T. Ramsey in early Jan. meeting to get info. needed for airline ticket for fuel mgt. swap deal going. Also, followup up with Tawney, Taylor, and Engberg (plastics) in early Jan.

Everett, I am asking for your input as it is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the relationship owners. During the meeting yesterday - the following happened : a) Keith McAuliffe announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately (his replacement has yet to be named). My perception is that Keith took the hit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales projections. EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected targets. b) Bob Jordan - Director NA Sales reporting to Jerry Earle will expand his existing Enron sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server Agreement c) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS Services. For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an 8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters. EBS sent Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th. Compaq has not paid the invoice. Lou Casari's team is handling the delinquency and notifying Compaq. Compaq ( Keith M.'s stewardship) had agreed to pay. Bob stated that EBS has not performed to Compaq's satisfaction under the Server Agreement and Compaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS services (Bob's first negotiation position). d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in the EBS Server Spend amount. Compaq (Bob Jordan) value - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and hardware in 2000 EBS (added) - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million for servers and hardware in 2000 EBS (added) - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in 1999 EBS (added) - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional services (costs for Server deployment) From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the following might occur EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000 at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters) Compaq total is $5.1 million spend at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase amount of $408,000 EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount is $4,134,229. (I did not concede) e) 2000 income. Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had to pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, 2002. If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the right to spend against the amount. To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS worked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS consulting services provided to Compaq. Again, under Keith M's stewardship - they verbally agreed to pay. Now with the above information - my offered next steps : a) Until everything is done - maintain the ""stick"" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 million). This is being done. b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee. It does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages. Prior conversations have discussed Compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee (again with Keith M). This could be recognized as yr 2000 income. c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on services of $4.1 million. This is a good return for a commodity transaction. So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier relationship. So...... please let me know your thougths. We have countered with the $2.5 million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000.

"Mr. Shankman: In preparation for the meeting on December 11th with Larry Kellner, CFO, Continental Airlines I have noted below some background on the Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting. We would appreciate your answers to a couple of questions below. Background: Ron Howard, Vice President, Continental Food Services, met earlier this year with George Wasaff, Managing Director, Enron Corporation Global Strategic Sourcing and Tracy Ramsey, Sourcing Portfolio Leader, to review the strong business relationship in fuel management and travel services which Enron has had with Continental Airlines. Discussions were held as to how this relationship could be expanded favorably for both companies. A subsequent meeting held October 25th enabled decision makers from both companies to act on these earlier discussions and explore opportunities to expand beyond the current fuel management and travel initiatives to those in weather derivatives and plastics hedging. December 11th Meeting Purpose: Follow-up from October 25th meeting to specifically address Larry Kellner (who could not make the October 25th meeting) on three initiatives in order of $ magnitude: (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis. Location: Larry Kellner's office will be getting back to us regarding his availability to do a quick tour of the trading floor. If he can make it for a trading floor tour Kellner would meet at Enron Corporation; otherwise, he is requesting that Enron Executives meet in his executive offices at 1600 Smith Street. Is either location fine for you or do you have a specific preference? Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines: Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative) Mr. Shankman, who would you like to have at the meeting from Enron? To date, we have coordinated through John Nowlan. At the October 25th meeting, Alan Engberg and Mark Tawney presented the plastics hedging and weather derivatives opportunities, respectively. Next week, I will be forwarding a short briefing which outlines Enron's current relationship with Continental in fuel management and the proposed initiatives in both weather derivatives and plastics hedging. Larry Gagliardi, Craig Breslau, Alan Engberg, and Gary Taylor are all providing input on this.

"Sarah-Joy, Here is an update per your request. Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with an Enron counteroffer. Any news on this? I spoke to John briefly this morning. Fed-Ex (Memphis) has not been in contact with our legal all last week. John supports our move today to begin moving business to UPS. I have left a message to Carmen to call me ASAP. My message is to inform her of our movement of significant corporate office business beginning today. I have every expecation that Carmen will call me back this afternoon. Since the discussions aren't happening, I doubt that we will be flying to Memphis, but I'll advise of any changes as they occur. Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop regarding: a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14; b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18 c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22 d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if necessary and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex.

"David and Bob, We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS relationship. EBS has identified potential server business opportunities (storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together. After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as the point person for these communications. EBS had prior direction from Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe or Kent Major. Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and issues. EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop the streaming media server solutions. We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions. EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions. To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our relationship. The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change. Until those changes are made: 1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services: Per the Agreement, Compaq was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. Compaq had agreed to the invoice amount. EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 on or before December 31,2000. 2) Potential for Agreement Termination: Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself). The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000. The concept to start over with a new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting. EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal. Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

"Jeff, As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater involvement in the EBS relationship. In the past, EBS had included David on the direction of our relationship and not the details. Our prior direction was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication. In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement. I would like to fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history. During the meetings in August 2000, EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended. There was a group of at least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq). Both EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services. Spreadsheets were exchanged between both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon. A significant amount of time was spent in this process between August through October. EBS and Compaq (Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 sections. This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for comments in November. EBS has not heard anything regarding the language. During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000. The EBS concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services. This was reason for the development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000). EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with our relationship.

"Chaz & Steve, I was able to review our recently completed conference call w/BMC with Jennifer Medcalf. During the call, Bernie Goicoechea and Ann(e?) Munson expressed that during their last few months of interaction with Enron Net Works, they have attempted to understand the exact issues and concerns which Net Works has with regard to selection/use of BMC's products. Bernie voiced that he hasn't been able to get more detail on the problems or nature of concerns that Net Works has, beyond what you and I know. The BMC account team feels that without specifics, they cannot address the issues accurately or in a timely fashion. The Enron Net Works team has expressed concern that various BMC products are not Windows 2000 certified (at least, not the ones they are focused on, and not in writing). Net Works also have some other concerns relative to the (Net Works) team's feelings that the BMC products (in some areas) ""...haven't kept up with the industry"", and that they (Net Works) have some residual issues with the BMC account support in general. Bottom Line, expressed by Net Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMC software product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC. You related Jim Crowder's suggestion related to the use of indemnification and liquidated damages clauses being implemented. Jennifer and I discussed this situation, and our meetings with your team, in context. We have a possible alternative for you to consider: perhaps EBS might provide a hedge for Net Works in the form of ""advance purchase"" of BMC product. For example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, but needs to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in total Enron purchases from BMC. A way in which you could reach the $3 million mark with BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMC time to ""click"" might be this: EBS buys all $3 million worth of BMC software, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other $2 million is used as a ""future purchases"" fund, in which EBS buys, but does not take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) current software... THEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases of BMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software is delivered from/by BMC. That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the other business units aren't spending any of today's dollars for product which they seem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified product when they need it in the future). In addition, you secure the business with BMC right now. I'm sure you could also figure out how to account for the time value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage to you. If all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In the meantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted on progress.

We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR. It looks as if during the month of June, the book administor loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but assigned multiple master deal ID's.

(etc..) This problem makes it impossible to backtest.... Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily increasing your limit to $45 million. This limit increase is in effect until July 26th. The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution can be devised..... I hope this helps.

"David: Do you have a simulation set up that will allow me to simulate trades by pushing a buy or sell button and will move the two way so i can try simulating actual market cicumstances? From: David Forster/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/08/2001 09:55 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Savita Puthigai/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: John, You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last Trade is Mid. Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality. The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis). As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. As Bias increases, the Offset increases. I'll call later to see what you think of the idea. Dave Program Criteria The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be: Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last [Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product. Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow. Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4]. #Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred. #Sells - The number of Sells which have occured. Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).} Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs. Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs. Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1. Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal to 1. Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.04] Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.50] Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0]. Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0.50] Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A possible value for this might be [0.01] Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds. Program Outputs The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula: Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. Normally ""False"" Program Interface and Operation Principles The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread value. Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain the Spread-Offset Minimum. GUI/Formulas Example: Constants Intensity Factor: [4] Dead Interval: [240] Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3] Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3] Spread Minimum [0.04] Spread Maximum [0.50] Offset Minimum [0] Offset Maximum [0.49] Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01] INPUTS OUTPUTS Intensity Formula Formula # Intensity Spread Offset Suspension S1 >220 -0.01 n/a F S2 <30 +0.01 n/a F S3 <10 +0.02 n/a F Transaction Formula Formula # # Transactions Spread Offset Suspension V1 <4 n/a -0.01 F V2 >3 n/a +0.01 F V3 >5 +0.01 +0.02 F V4 >10 +0.02 +0.04 F V5 >15 +0.04 +0.15 F V6 >20 n/a n/a T Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured. In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through the GUI. Simulation Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction, please see the attached: Additional Features System Notifications There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). Offset checks will only be against a maximum value. Dave",Normal,1,1,0
"saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate margins/absolute position limits/var. as these guys are taking off the front, they are also buying back summer. el paso large buyer of next winter today taking off spreads. certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong on the way up and such a piece now. really the only one left with any risk premium built in is h/j now. it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, down 40+ from this morning. certainly if we are entering a period of bearish to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked. certainly understand the arguments for h/j. if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.

"John, Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations. First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the plant, so that wouldn't help. Second, it seems there are more of these ""portable pipeline"" units floating around than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas (in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E has one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the pipeline system in California. This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG consultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested in looking further into transporting LNG into California. Assuming that we could get a few ""portable pipelines"" and some trucks, there are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG: Location Owner Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day) Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage (gal) Storage (mmcf) Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000 7.4 100,000 8.2 LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000 1.64 100,000 8.2 Sacramento 57,600 4.72 132,000 10.8 LaBarge, WY Exxon 60,000 4.92 Evanston, WY Amoco 95,000 7.8 100,000 8.2 Totals 26.48 Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to providing methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with LNG fleet owners. I'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting.",Normal,0,0,0

"a couple more thoughts. certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to switching and slowdown in economy. Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing plants for instance. switching is significant and has led to cash in the gulf expiring weak everyday. gas daily spread to prompt trading at $1....need some very cold weather to justify that. this seems to be the test of the next 3-5 days. Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub. unless we get some crazy prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market. funny watching the flies in the front. Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 friday morning. probably worth 1.30 now. crazy. people have seen each front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h. what's the thoughts on distillates... is it tight enough such that gas switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market too oversupplied to care?",Normal,0,0,0

"Re: trucking LNG to California - The short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option for endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only two plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military and industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I was not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and Topock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern California and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and subsequent loading onto trucks. Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into 820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could deliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely transfer it into storage. The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under repair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some reason. I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. Please let me know if you have specific questions.",Normal,0,0,0

Through the year's (Sounds like Im really old) I have learned that the really great Individuals come down on themselves for circumstances beyond their control when in fact their performance is far beyond what anyone else could have done. I believe you are one of those individuals. I appreciate what you have done with EOL and the burden you have had to take on. This especially hits home when I see what has happened to you P/L the last 3 months. You are expected to carry the world without having any NYMEX liquidity to cover your risk. I would like to offer to transfer $30 million out of the Storage Book to the Price Book. Without you and EOL I could never have done what I've done. Thanks, Jim Schwieger",Normal,0,0,0

To answer your question: It is looking more and more like the week of January 8th. The meetings would be held using approximately 1.5 days of a 3-day window: the 9th, 10th, and 11th. I have input from Kim Godfrey, who is driving things on the EBS side, and I have a tentative OK from Avaya for the window of the 9th - 11th. I will want to begin getting headcount of the EBS travelers, and the day(s) which each would be attending. For example, you would probably attend both days, while some of your team would be there exclusively for the 2nd day meetings. I'm not sure Jim Crowder would be at both days, but Kim G. certainly would, as would members of her origination team, including Systems Engineer(s). I will call you this week to get your input re: who from your team would be going, and for which days.

Individual items per person follow immediately: Jim, I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th. If Larry and Everett can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in for, I would like to book your time for the meeting. Larry, I have left you a voicemail, and this note. Please let me know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you. Everett, I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on her voicemail. Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, as well. Will you also let me know which days (above) work best for you? Steve Pearlman, You and I have spoken, I have your availability info. Thank you. To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip: the first day (only) is for executives to investigate the following items -- 1) what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.) EBS sell EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use 2) ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into a ""sell through/sell with"" arrangement, whereby some type of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined. EBS sell with, and/or through the Avaya sales organization The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the: 1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above, discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues and opportunities and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales & marketing team. Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both days due to the nature of his mission. Please let me know as soon as you can which day or days would work best for you to make the trip. I need to get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing center facility.

"Z/F !!!! wow. Who would have thunk it. Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as wide as last year. Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip. Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango. if it couldn't do it this year.... A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve told them to do last bid week. Obviously, more gas trying to come out than is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an Enron, to inject. Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling it out in G. When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f. Storage economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of winter. Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways. Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong. storage boys are withdrawing today and buying that. bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it going to zero? slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/22/2000 06:50:46 AM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc: Subject: re:mkts agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up buying em back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time is busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have the time. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways but one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called impact of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate at all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon. also will be curious how these ""loan deals"" by pipes work ouut. man these guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in the back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep that part of the curve very strong agree? be cool my man-talk later",Normal,0,0,0

Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been significant. i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day. understand they are changing their view somewhat tomorrow. wait and see if it relieves some back pressure. very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 considering the scenario that's being painted. slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/21/2000 01:06:40 PM To: jarnold@enron.com cc: Subject: re:mkts johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled all the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was long mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure. but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to mark silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. any great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it. guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling dry up??",Normal,0,0,0

Once generation is sold its fuel consumption is no longer reported to the DOE. Hence an analysis of the DOE cost and quality of generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA gets around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data.

"Jennifer: Mike Rabon had just forwarded to me this helpful synopsis of the opportunity with Kinko's as he sees it. I would like to forward this on to James Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and cc Mike Rabon). Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention ""Gary King"" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail? Thanks for your suggestion! SJ Mr. Thompson: Here are several ""touchpoints"" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate broadband solutions architect at Kinko's. You may recall having met Mike Rabon in the October 6th meeting. Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches. Kinko's had expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to it in the spring 2001 time frame. Enron's goal would be to make a needs assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it pertains to: Near term network planning. IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential. IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit capacity. Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about your storage strategy and growth. Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the hubs. Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality. Enron's utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic and video traffic to traverse the same network. Mike Rabon would like to speak to the Video Conferencing product manager. Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be communicated to the proper person.",Normal,0,0,0
"The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate unique deal. An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 8th, 2000. It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and Q86409.4. These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore count as a total of four deals. We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as just one large deal with 4 different parts. Unfortunately, the EOL Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal. Since this currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals. This results in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals. If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask. Pete Berzins x57597",Normal,0,0,0

"Thad, Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual meetings? We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in NJ. Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week. However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible alignments and opportunities. This would include two primary areas: 1) EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use: what types of potential solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and 2) EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the (common) markets served: ""sell with"" (each other); and ""sell through"" (channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as sales channels for each other's sales forces. These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value propositions, such that they would have a ""jumping off point"" for a go-to-market effort (item #2, above). In addition, the technical aspects of some of the (item #1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be addressed. Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days synchronized with your executives'.

"Jennifer, I hope you are doing well in the U.K., as my clock here says it is probably about 4:52pm in London...Here is an update on BMC: Based on the following, I would say this: 1) BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works, and in one situation, appears to have done so successfully. 2) Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of #1 were desired or acceptable, and instead offered another pushback (Win2K certif'ctn), therefore 3) BMC doesn't appear to have been given further opportunity to identify what issues, if any, are still open at Net Works. 4) I don't see evidence (either in these notes OR having come out from any of the many telephone conversations I've been in) that Net Works has provided any responses since 11/21 or so...Peter Goebel and I met w/Net Works & EBS on 11/17, and I have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for information relative to ""what are your top 3 problems in this BMC situation, Net Works?"" from Net Works. 5) So, I feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by Net Works) than will be discussed, because 6) Net Works doesn't want any of BMC's solutions. Period. 7) The Result: EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net Works' folks are concerned. In the ""I don't want any surprises"" mode, I thought I'd give George a heads-up re: possible fallout around the BMC thing. I told George in this morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team (""I don't see a problem here...""), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for ""credit"", which any ENE business unit could access, etc. I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were likely to encourage Crowder to ""lean on"" Philippe (which I had recommended against). George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub. If you have any questions, please let me know.

"Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us. If they shop the deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal. Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published. Physical deals settle much later. My understanding is this is a financial deal. From: Russell Dyk @ ENRON 10/23/2000 12:43 PM To: Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging Deal The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of. In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details. There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify. First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it, for the December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment would take place on February 15, 2000. Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this transaction. CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end of this week. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Regards, Russ",Normal,0,0,1

As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to install the application itself. Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting?

"Adam: Hope your interview goes well. Things are going crazy in the gas market so, unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews. As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview. Be confident. Answer the question asked. Don't be afraid to say you don't know but don't make excuses. Express interest in why you find Enron appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing. The trading training program is still in the works. Few people outside the trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask any questions about it in the interviews. If you receive an offer, it would probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the training program when you arrive. Not sure about that last statement though. The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure trading business areas: gas and power. There are still a large number of other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall under the program. That's a function of the program being developed by the head of these two businesses. Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet. Write me about how your interviews went.

"It's funny the spreads in gas. First, in gas, you can play the seasonality game. Does anybody want to buy M/N at 1 back. No, of course not. But in crude, m/n at .10 back is normal. definitely a game as you try to keep month on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is. that's why cal 2 is as high as it is. when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt month. i can't remember w/o looking at charts. it's always the mentality of: if it's tight now what about July or what about winter. i think that's why the winter spreads are a piece. the z/f/g fly is interesting. i think z/f can and will settle backw. just a high prob it goes cantango first. Still seeing sellside interest in term. definitely a result of pira. will probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them and watches the front of the curve. previous to that conference, the producers just didnt want to sell anything. tired of writing us a big check every month. so not only am i in on weekends, but they just put a computer in my house so i can work at home at night. it's really my only time to sit and think without the phones and eol going crazy. they better pay me for the decline in my lifestyle . slafontaine@globalp.com on 10/15/2000 09:26:31 PM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc: Subject: Re: mkts what is a young pup like you doing working on saturday? yea ill check again the numbers but pretty sure they said +3 bcf by dec. ill let you know/its been along week/weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me. i know this isnt same as crude-less mature but getting there so im always wondering if/when the mentality will start to go more that way-ie inverses shud be for only 1 reason-that supply/demand balance will get less tite than it is today. some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk too they still in-im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growing deliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds-and 30 cts inverses will be hard to maintain unless we have crazy weather. we're only 2 weeks from withdrawel period so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds until all the length bails. your rite on the mkt-the anticipation is in the mkt-you gotta have flat px to make money,my approach in the short term as well. that said everyone at pira including pira all bull bull the winter-will be good i think for a win/sum01/win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap. fyi-pira also bearish crude-not saying they rite but will have impact on natgas producers sentiment short term-esp as mideast starts to fiad. for you be careful of the politics effecting heating oil, natgas watching too. there will be some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futs negatively and therefore may roll to natgas-ie if ho goes a big discount to natgas before any major cold-gas will get hit i think. if i hear anything on oil side ill be happy to pass it on-apprec comment on producers not that im surpirsed, wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparks getting hit lately?? good luck man-talk soon. pira was good. you go next year ill set up you some interesting people,good to network cuz we never know where we'll end up. by the way-you bullish sum 02/win 02 or are you rolling a short? non of my biz but i was on the other side-ill add if it narrows more. inkjections next summer will be huge albeit from low stx-curve will mean revert eventually.",Normal,0,0,0

If Larry and Everett can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in for, I would like to book your time for the meeting. Larry, I have left you a voicemail, and this note.

Everett, I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on her voicemail. Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, as well. Will you also let me know which days (above) work best for you? Steve Pearlman, You and I have spoken, I have your availability info. Thank you. To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip: the first day (only) is for executives to investigate the following items -- 1) what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.) EBS sell EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use 2) ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into a ""sell through/sell with"" arrangement, whereby some type of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined. EBS sell with, and/or through the Avaya sales organization The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the: 1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above, discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues and opportunities and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales & marketing team. Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both days due to the nature of his mission. Please let me know as soon as you can which day or days would work best for you to make the trip.

I assume it is the former, not the latter. Is this correct? Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter? Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know. Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.

"I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average of prices, 5 per week. From: Gary Taylor 10/05/2000 07:25 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Griffith/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: SMUD deal Asian options John(s), How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published? or will it triple count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a similar calculation on weekends). I assume it is the former, not the latter. Is this correct? Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter? Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know. Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.

"Adam: Good question. The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly identical product. The fight is over which execution model is superior. I would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct. It's happened in Europe already. The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry. Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically. I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct. The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful. It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

"Russell: I think I should give you a little background on small ventures. Bill Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship. He is an extremely creative individual. Whalley actually commented on him today as someone ""who thinks outside the box"". Bill actually sat in a bar four years and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth. He has been successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas. As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron. He throws out ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one. He pointed out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for Enron. In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within reason. I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be considered a high priority. I am willing to accept some of the credit risk exposure as a cost of doing business. Bill understands his role as an independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for someone with finite capital. I place very high confidence in Bill not conducting high risk trades. Having said that, we certainly need to monitor his credit exposure and continue to require LC's. Just understand that he is at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade counterparty. I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread option he traded. He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the trading desk, knew it as well. There are a couple isolated products that Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations. This was one product. Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing models created by the research group. The problem with these models is that they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental price limitations. For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within variable cost than the models predict. Thus it is necessary to apply a correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used. Obviously, we have this function in our pricing models. I was not aware this methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models. This has since been changed. Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products. Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to Enron. I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting credit. I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade considering the circumstances. If you believe differently, please advise. Thanks, John",Normal,0,0,0

"I'm not sure what is happening on my position. It may have to do with how you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.

Under the $7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price curves proportionally shifted. Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly. Key findings include: $7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79% $9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the financial desk actually decreased. This would seem to imply that up to the seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces risk). But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and increasing VaR by 74%.

"Dave: A couple things about the limit orders: 1: When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open should default to 12 hours. We want the orders open as long as possible. Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour. Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading session unless specified otherwise. 2. Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size. When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...). I could not overwrite the quantity to be 15,000. 3. Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system saying error trade, price not available. 4. Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, without canceling it and resubmitting a new one? If not, this would be a valuable feature. Thx, John",Normal,0,0,0
